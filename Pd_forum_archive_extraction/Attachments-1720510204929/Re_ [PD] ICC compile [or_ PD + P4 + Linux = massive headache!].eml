i'm not completely shure how icc for ia32 can handle denormals ... their
64bit compiler has a flag to flush denormals to zero, but not the ia32
compiler...

well, there is pd's PD_BADFLOAT macro that _should_ to that, too, but
this has only effect if the nubers are already denormal, so maybe it's
a good idea to reset the value to flush every number a 24 / 32 bit dac

morning Ian,

you can use [glue] from zexy to paste together lists, or if you're
using a [send]/[receive] pair, you can use [sprinkler] (together
with [glue] or something like [cxc.prepend]) to distribute
variable-length messages ... all of the above should be available
in CVS.

What are the maintainers of the windoze packages of PD using to compile? 
Whatever it is, it seems to clear up any denormal or CPU spike problems.

Can you tell me a bit more about this? How and where should I start with 
that?

I have found that certain objects have *stong* denormal tendencies, 
including hip~, lp~, np~, throw~, catch~ and probably more that I 
haven't weeded out yet.

The bottom line is that patches which are completely fine to run on 
windoze and on most AMD processors with Linux completely screw up my P4 
laptop. We are talking grinding halts of DSP, sudden [+ lasting!] leaps 
of CPU usage over 100% and even completely freezing the machine if I 
happen to be in realtime mode. Not pretty.

This has made me very careful about my patches these days, and while it 
has improved my patching technique immensely ;-), it is still a real 
problem when I am the only one getting errors with my own patches, and 
everyone else who tests them in a different environment has none at all.

I've written this list about it several times now, but I am not a C 
programmer, so there are only limited things which I can do [besides 
buying a new laptop or switching back to winschnoz]. Trying to recompile 
with a different compiler is one of them.

Using "./configure --enable-icc --enable-optimize=pentium4 
--enable-jack --enable-fftw" still uses GCC. Using "CC=icc CXX=icc" 
tells it to use ICC, but I get an error that the C compiler cannot 
create executables. I have a hunch that this is because I still haven't 
gotten this ridiculous key ["It should arrive within one business day", 
sez Intel...]

I [heart] computers.

just a guess, but maybe the linux system libraries create more denormals
than the windows ones ...

the PD_BADFLOAT macro is currently just checking for actual denormals...
denormals occur at about 1e-34 ... a 32 bit dac should have a resolution
of about 5e-10 ... so i suppose we could implement a macro that flushes
everything below 1e-12 to zero... the best would be to find a fancy
mask, to detect these numbers ... well, you'll have to mess around with
mantissa ... if you could have a look at this it would be great...

well, digital filters and other delay lines are dangerous about
denormals, but i'm a bit confused about the throw~ / catch~ objects ...
i haven't had a look at the code, but to me it seems they just copy
sample arrays ...

you shouldn't have to set the CC or CXX variables ... i'll have a look
at it ... about the configure message ... is you icc executable in the
/usr/bin path? if not, you'll probably have to create a symlink to it...

Hmm, ok, point taken, although I do not agree fully with all of your
reasoning. I still have to find the time to reintroduce the working
version s_alsa.c in a recent pd version. If someone wants to give it
a try, just take s_alsa from the devel_0_36 branch and adapt it
to pd 0.37 changed audio structure.
As long as I don't have a HDSP card I might not find the motivation
to do so. I am sorry, I am terribly lazy :(

hi Georg,

before an event stream starts, send a message 'retrack' to
xeq_record -- a recording track has to get a valid name first.
Valid name is <tracknumber>-<basename>, so it might be 'record,
retrack 1-track', or 'retrack 777-test, record', etc.  For some
odd reason the default name is not valid.

Track naming rules are inflexible, undocumented, and unwise...

My ICC is from Gentoo, which puts it in /opt. I symlinked

/usr/bin/icc -> /opt/intel/compiler80/bin/icc

but it still starts with GCC. Also tried various other combinations of 
directories etc, but still the same. The only way to get it to use ICC 
is with CC or CXX flags.

Subject: [PD] is there also a [symbol2list]?

hi

there is the [list2symbol]-object from zexy. with this object it is possible
to create symbols with SPACES (very special!!!)
I'm looking for a possibility to reseparate such a symbol with space, so
that i get 2 symbols again. Maybe a [symbol2list] would do that. Or is there
another way to split a symbol in 2 parts?

my problem (maybe another solution would be more realistic):
i'd like to send pairs of symbols with [netclient] to other [netclient]s
over a [netserver]. Important is, that the receiver gets these two symbol as
a pair. the solution i use now, is: every second message completes a pair,
but now it could happen, when two [netclient]s send at the same time, that
the receiver (another [netclient])  gets two wrong pairs ( a1 b1 / a2 b2
instead of  a1 a2 / b1 b2 )

or in general:
how to send lists of various length over [netclient]/[netserver]?

well, i'd suggest using [symbol2list] from zexy. it has a settable 
delimiter (which defaults to SPACE)

well, it should be very simple.
just prepend "send" to your list of variable length (there are thousands 
of libraries/externals offering this functionality, e.g: [glue] from 
zexy, or [prepend] from iemlib)

e.g: [send 1 2 3( (on the client-side) will send a list "1 2 3" to the 
server, while [send list of a lot of symbols" will send "list of a lot 
of symbols"

Subject: [PD] GEM OS X : Window not draggable ...

Hi all,

I'm using the OS X port of GEM (0.888-pre1) on an iBook. When I create 
a window I get the output:

MAC: BuildGLonWindow: fDraggable= false
MAC: BuildGLonWindow: not draggable on single device
MAC: BuildGLonWindow (!pcontextInfo->fDraggable && (numDevices == 1))

the created window is - as the output suggests - not draggable, not 
focusable and - what's worse - mouse events are not passed to it, 
effictively making the use of gemmouse impossible.

what is the reason for this and is there a workaround to use gemmouse 
after all? What devices is BuildGLonWindow talking about - gfxcards, 
monitors,...?

thanks,

gl03.-
