i like it, its kinda fun - you can have a sound orbiting then jumble up 
the speaker definitions in various ways
not very elegant perhaps but simple and can give some nice results with 
minimum fuss
would be interested to hear how other people create spatialisation 
routines/choreographies...

yes this happens, thats why i was wondering if it was possible to to 
send a message rather than initiating a new instance
not that this may help, just wanted to give it a try...
