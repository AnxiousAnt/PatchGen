hello all,

I'm working on an XY controller abstraction that has a number of methods.

Problem is I already have 4 inlets and don't want to add a fifth.

The first inlet takes messages, 0/1/show/hide for on and off, etc. The second sets the interpolation speed, and the 3rd and 4th are the setable x-y coords.

I can't get my first inlet to take both symbol's and numbers without select generating errors on the console.

Whats the best way to funnel the input by datatype? floats out one inlet, symbols out another, lists out another etc.. ?

I right now have all my values converted into symbol via "symbol" object, then sent to 4 selects (select show, select 1 etc..) problem is when the symbol 1 is sent to select 1 it does nothing, does not see it at all, so numbers should not be changed to symbols for use with select. If I don't convert the words "show" and "hide" to symbols first then the "select" objects complain about not having methods for "show" or "hide"

PS: anyone using accelerated controllers? (by accelerated I mean the smoothly go from the current position to the target non-linearly. The start off slow and accelerate towards the target, when they get close then they slow down and stop smoothly. My x-y controller does this but I was thinking just an abtsraction that acts like line, but does it with acceleration, would be useful? 

Thanks!
Ben
