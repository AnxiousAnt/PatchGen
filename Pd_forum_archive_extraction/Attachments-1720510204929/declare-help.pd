#X text 44 40 A declare object adds one or more directories to the
search path \, and/or pre-loads one or more libraries ("extensions")
to Pd in preparation for opening the patch from a file. Usage is "declare
[-flag value] [-flag value] ..." where the flag can be:;
#X text 31 182 -lib;
#X text 31 198 -stdlib;
#X text 31 146 -path;
#X text 31 162 -stdpath;
#X text 129 146 add to search path \, relative to the patch;
#X text 129 163 add to search path \, relative to the Pd;
#X text 129 182 load a library \, relative to the patch;
#X text 129 199 load a library \, relative to Pd;
#X text 40 231 (for any of these you may use a full pathname such as
"/tmp/dir" or \, in Windows \, "C:/garbage" instead of a relative path).
;
#X text 39 293 For instance \, if you put abstractions and/or other
supporting files in a subdirectory "more" \, you can put an object
\, "declare -path more" to make sure Pd sees them when the patch is
loaded. Or \, if you have zexy installed in the directory extra/zexy
(in the Pd installation") you can get it using "declare -stdpath extra/zexy".
