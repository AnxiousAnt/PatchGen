Mac \, the quit menu under the application menu \, not file.) didn't
try this with any sound of video stuff \, just the stuff you see on
the left.;
#X obj 95 309 print text;
#X text 346 263 4 the same thing will happen when the spigot is off
\, and an open brace is entered \, and then the widget receives a bang
and tries to print it...;
#X text 346 318 5 and did you notice that I wrote this \, all without
typing an open brace. Why?;
