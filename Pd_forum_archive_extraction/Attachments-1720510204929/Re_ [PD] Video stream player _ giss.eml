i don't know if it works on mac,
and don't have any time/will to make it work there,
but it's perfectly fine on linux :

two little restrictions :

* be careful to work at the same audio freq
that the freq of the stream ( often 22050 )

* encoding and decoding in the same patch
can produce some crashes,
located in libtheora.
