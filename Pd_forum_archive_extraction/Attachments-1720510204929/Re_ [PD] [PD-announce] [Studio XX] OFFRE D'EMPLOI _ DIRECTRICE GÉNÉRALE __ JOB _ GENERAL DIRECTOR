err, hum, darsha, let's speak clearly a bit,

ok, maybe boys are tolerated in the studio xx,
but you know the line,
no guy will be invited for a workshop there...

and i understand the system,
3 years ago, girls i knew used to have a sense
of humor on this, but now that it has turned
into a institutionalized and funded system,
lots have lost their sense of humor.
yeh the equation is true : money <> humor

i don't blame any person in this,
just getting back in the 70's feminist
separatist model
will not help much,
as building separate schools
for jewish and arabs in israel
didn't help much
( but they were both wrong
with their creationist/religious teaching )

enough for now,
sevy
