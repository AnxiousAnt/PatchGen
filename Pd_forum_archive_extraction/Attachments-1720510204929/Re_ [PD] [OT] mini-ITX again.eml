try the http://www.pcengines.ch/alix1c.htm or the newer 
http://www.pcengines.ch/alix3c3.htm

I used alix1c for wireless node at okno.be, not pd stuff already, but 
they are realy well dezigned and solid.
the AMD Geode LX800 (500Mhz) is x86/x87 compatible, has mmx/3DNow! fpu 
with 256Mb SDRAM, and the board has audio and vesa port already.
and they are realy cheap : around 100€ ... I was considering buying one 
for pd patches.

we installed openwrt kamikaze on it, but you can install any other linux 
like debian with ease ...

hope it helps a bit...

Olm-e.
