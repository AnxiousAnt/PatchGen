Some little scripts for info extraction from Pd patches.


Make a list of internal objects:

 ./internals.sh ~/src/pd-0.41-4 >pd-0.41-4.txt

Get a list of objects used by a patch:

./objs.sh <mypatch.pd >mypatch.txt

Get a list of externals used by a patch:

./objs.sh <mypatch.pd | ./externals.sh pd-0.41-4.txt

Ignore abstractions found in a directory:

./objs.sh <patch/my.pd | ./abstractions.sh patch/


Ride the pipeline:

cat *.pd | ./objs.sh | ./externals.sh pd-0.41-4.txt | ./externals.sh Gem.txt | ./abstractions.sh ./
