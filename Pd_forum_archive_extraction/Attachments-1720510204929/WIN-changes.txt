GGEXT-changes to make it run under WINdos
of course you need pd-0.25 to use this extern (but that goes for linux too)
you'll need Visual C++ 6.0 (mICROsOFT) to compile it right


makefile:
>change "current: linux" to "current: NT"
>remove the IRIX- and LINUX-sections of the makefile (this 
>change paths...
>add toddle.obj slider.obj envgen.obj w_envgen.obj savestate.obj adsr.obj ticker.obj(?)
>add "$(PDNTLDIR)\uuid.lib" to the PDNTLIB-setting

ggext.c
<unbelievable :: I didn't find any winbugs...

streamin.c
>replace line 165: "char* cbuf = (char*)getbytes(sizeof(char)*n);" is better
>delete line 166
>line 167(was 168): replay "(char*)tbuf" with "cbuf"
?> I suggest to remove (or comment out) the lines 133-142 (that is "FD_SET"..."return(w+4);}")
?> I do not know why, but on my system pd crashes because of segmentation faults...


streamout.c

of course it would be great, not to simply remove lines and change them without thinking, but to use pre-compiler-directives:: #ifdef linux etc...


changes on pd itself...

m_pd.h
>line 478: add "EXTERN " before the "void sys_vgui(..."
>line 479: add "EXTERN " before the "void sys_gui(..."

g_array.c
>line 286: remove the "static" before the "void garray_usedindsp(..." declaration

g_canvas.h
>line 212: add "EXTERN " before the "t_canvas *glist_getcanvas(..."
>line 220: add "EXTERN " before the "void glist_grab(..."
>line 221: add "EXTERN " before the "int glist_isvisible(..."
>line 270: add "EXTERN " before the "void canvas_fixlinesfor(..."
>line 271: add "EXTERN " before the "void canvas_deletelinesfor(..."
>line 311: add "EXTERN void garray_usedindsp(t_garray *x);"

after that you will have to recompile pd...
