When you send MIDI into pd, what do you expect to happen?

MIDI coming into pd will not make any sound, it will provide messages to
control things that make sound, if you build them or load them.

You should not be running jack or pd as root usually, if you are running
jack as root you need to run pd as root too, or better yet, run both as
your regular login.
