I have been using GEM on windows for a while now and had crash problems a while back but i have settled on the follwing process and i havent had any crashes lately.
1. using GEM 0.87 (no qt!) 
2. encode video to avi  using virtualdub with cinepack (400x300) (not a great codec, i know) - because i want position control of the video i encode the video with a keyframe every 1 frame.
3. dimensions of the video should match standard aspect ratio. and be a multiple of 4.

I found that the larger the dimensions the more likely a crash (not sure if its bit rate related or something else) but i am using pix_delay in my patch and found if i took that out vids that did crash - didnt crash after removing the pix-delay. And using video with different codecs seemd to make more crashes so i encoded all my video to one codec (cinepack).

Yes, the Windows version 0.90 does crash when loading Quicktime clips.  I
have done some work to fix this and hopefully the results will be available
soon.

The other recommendations for Photo-Jpeg on OSX are good ones.
