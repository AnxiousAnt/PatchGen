#X text 333 28 this patch slices a file into 16 pieces and indicates
which slice is being played via the hradio. taping t sets the tempo.
space plays and stops. the loop width can be set with the radios. tempo
can be adjusted on the fly with the slider. transposition can be adjusted
on the fly. keys 1-4 move the slice indicator to slices 1-4 \, QWER
to slices 5-8 \, ASDF to slices 9-12 \, ZXCV to slices 13-16. B reverses
the slice \, N reverses the sequence \, G glitches the patch \, H holds
the slice. \, and . increase and decrease the amount of times the the
hold function repeats a slice in the space of one beat. it's a pretty
simple patch and doesn't do much yet so I'd appreciate feedback and
suggestiong for improvement.;
