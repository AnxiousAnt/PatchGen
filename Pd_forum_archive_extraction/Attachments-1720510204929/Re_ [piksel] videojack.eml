ola again,

it was so straightforward to do,
reading a little bit the code
of mjpegtools_yuv_to_v4l by Jan Panteltje
that there is now a pdp_vloopback
in PiDiP, meaning that you can input your pd output
to any other program that supports v4l.

the only 'trick' is that the size is not detected automagically,
so your client must have the same size settings
than your pd patch.

you can get it from pd svn
( the only way to get pidip anyway )
it's in trunk/externals/pidip
and will be included in tonight's autobuild

salaam,
sevy
