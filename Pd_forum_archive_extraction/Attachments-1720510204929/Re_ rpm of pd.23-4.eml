No, 22-4 -> all MIDI worked, 23-1->no MIDI worked, 23-4->seg.fault on MIDI out.

PD connects to MIDI port, all audio is fine, but in any 23 release, I do not have MIDI, and in the lastest
release, MIID output cause immediate seg fault.

I suspect this error is more subtle than just your 23-4 changes,   Guenter, because of the loss of fuctionality at
23-1.
Your changes may just have exposed where RedHat OSS fails with new scheme.
