1
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:12,400
The purpose of this course is to show you how to

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,150
-- well, "show" I'm not sure is the right word --

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:23,700
is to enable you to make your own computer music applications, in the sense of designing electronic music instruments.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,850
What that means, in a sense, is making your computer do what

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,700
a guitar or a drum set does when you do things to it,

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,948
so that the thing is running in real time.

7
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:36,255
It's making sound

8
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:38,908
 and you walk up to it and do things to it,

9
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,786
and that changes the sound that it makes.

10
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:44,093
For instance, it might be silent until you start doing something and then it starts making noise.

11
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:49,524
Then you've got an instrument that does something that responds to how you're trying to get it to do things.

12
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:52,790
So this is a particular..

13
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:58,141
This thing, this idea of using computers to make computer music instruments is,

14
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:04,385
in some sense, sort of the trunk of the whole field of computer music, at least the way I see it.

15
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:08,100
Computer music grew out of, or maybe it's a part of,

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,326
the field which could be called electronic music, which started, depending on how you think of it, maybe in 

17
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:20,961
the late 1800s -- maybe in 1948 when the first tape recorder music started getting made.

18
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:25,819
Well, you could put other kinds of dates on it.

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:31,903
And the whole field of electronic music is basically people inventing ways of making music with electronic gear

20
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:35,985
as opposed to acoustic instruments.

21
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:42,926
It wasn't obvious, at first, when computers showed up on the scene that computers would eventually, essentially,

22
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:53,051
supplant all of the other electronic musical instruments that exist, which means the tape recorder, the synthesizer, all that kind of good stuff.

23
00:01:53,151 --> 00:02:00,482
But nowadays, everything that you could have found in an electronic music studio in the '50s, or '60s, or the '90s

24
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:06,280
is a piece of software on a screen on your computer with a couple of very important provisos.

25
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:11,730
Proviso number one is that a computer makes a rotten musical instrument in the sense that you can't strum it, 

26
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:15,976
or whap it, or any of those good things that you can do with acoustic instruments.

27
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:21,269
I'm not going to do a whole lot of talking about designing hardware interfaces 

28
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:26,360
for making computers that respond more naturally to musical impulses.

29
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,382
The reason I'm not going to talk about that is because it's its own subject.

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,723
And it's also a rather various subject.

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,382
Different people have completely different approaches to designing interfaces to computers.

32
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:43,382
It's such a wide, disorganized field that it's hard to figure out how to make a syllabus out of it in the first place.

33
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:47,996
So I'm just sort of going to ignore that and, to the extent that I need to actuate my computer

34
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:52,768
I'm going to be using keyboards, and a mouse, and the microphone.

35
00:02:55,473 --> 00:03:00,245
So other than that aspect of just getting inputs into the computer, I think that 

36
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:06,609
everything that you do now in electronic music, you at least can do on your computer.

37
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,382
So a couple of things about that, OK.

38
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:19,495
First off, what does making music with computers split up into as a set of things that you can do?

39
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:26,972
And my own taxonomy of what you do with computers to make them into computer instruments are that there are three

40
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,199
basic things that you might want to know how to do.

41
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:30,829
One is synthesize sounds.

42
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:37,271
What that means, at least what that means to me, is that you write down an algebraic equation

43
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:40,317
and it has a variable in it for time.

44
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:43,625
As time passes you just plug different numbers into the time slot,

45
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:49,544
and out comes a sinusoid or whatever it is that you told the equation to make, and then you get to hear it, right?

46
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:54,245
And if you came up studying mathematics like I did, this is paradise, right?

47
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:58,162
Any equation you can think of, you can listen to.

48
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,774
So that is synthesis, synthesizing sound.

49
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:06,954
That comes out of a long tradition of making stuff, like oscillators and filters that have

50
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:14,092
 existed for at least 100 years for doing that, before computers really came on the computer music scene.

51
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:21,491
A second thing is what I think people usually call either processing or signal processing,

52
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:28,194
which is a misnomer because signal processing means many other things besides what it means to computer musicians.

53
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:32,981
But at least if you're in a room with computer musicians and when someone says signal processing,

54
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:39,771
what they tend to mean is something that takes a sound in and changes it into something else to go out.

55
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:48,998
The most ubiquitous example, I think, is sampling, where you take a microphone up to something and make a recording,

56
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,132
and then you have a button that you press that plays it back.

57
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,516
And the only transformation is that you heard it at a different time from when you recorded it.

58
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:58,724
That's a perfect transformation, right?

59
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:07,713
In chapter seven, I think it is, you will find all sorts of things to do with that particular kind of transformation.

60
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,715
OK. That's item number two.

61
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:11,064
One was synthesis.

62
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,510
Two is signal processing.

63
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,198
Three is analysis, the idea of taking a sound that goes in and boiling it down to a set of parameters 

64
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:24,388
that describes what that sound is, or some aspect of what that sound is.

65
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:31,655
A very simple example of that is an envelope follower, which will tell you whether someone started playing an instrument or not

66
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:37,133
or more generally, tell you whether there seems to be sound coming into a microphone right now or not.

67
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:46,591
And you would use that, for instance, if you wanted to find out if someone was walking into a room so you could turn the lights on automatically.

68
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:54,203
Put up a microphone, hook it into an envelope follower, and then have it turn the lights on when the amplitude of the sound reaches a certain level.

69
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,303
So that's analysis.

70
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,758
That doesn't sound as interesting as synthesis or processing because there's no sound output, there's just sound input.

71
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,698
I hope you'll find out that there's a whole world of cool stuff you can do with that as well.

72
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:13,177
In terms of mental block-diagrams, if you want to think about what this all means:

73
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,291
Synthesis is, you have a box and it has an output.

74
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:20,039
But the input was something that isn't sound; the output is sound.

75
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,557
Analysis is, you have a box that has a sound input but not an output, and then

76
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:27,767
Processing is a thing where you have both input and output.

77
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:37,801
What I'm going to do to start with is start with synthesis because it's the easiest thing to get your computers to do.

78
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:44,664
Why? Because it's much easier to deal with speakers than it is to deal with microphones for reasons that I don't really understand very well.

79
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:52,334
But I want to give you some time to get used to how to get your microphones and your computers to be friends.

80
00:06:52,449 --> 00:07:01,503
That might make it more appropriate to wait a few weeks before, or however many weeks we can afford to wait, before we start doing that kind of stuff...

81
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:06,982
And just to make the gesture, I didn't bring a microphone today, although there will be microphones in the room later on.

82
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:10,903
What do I have to tell you?

83
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:17,074
I have to tell you some organizational things about the course that are boring but that you need to know.

84
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,418
There's a website, and the website tells you all the boring stuff that you need to know about the course.

85
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:26,186
The website will somewhat change in time.

86
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:38,873
What it does now is it tells you, week by week, what I believe the topics to be that this course will consist of.

87
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:48,149
Most of the time I'm actually able to do what I was planning to do, but sometimes it has to change for one reason or another.

88
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:53,867
So this is not a guarantee that this is what we're going to manage to do, but hopefully it's what we'll do.

89
00:07:54,444 --> 00:08:11,802
What you'll find is that as the quarter drags on there are going to be a certain number of assignments, which are things that you have to do with a computer that demonstrate that you have mastered one or another technique that is the topic of the week.

90
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:21,490
The first one of these is due a week from Thursday, that's to say Thursday of week two, and that is a tight deadline.

91
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:24,085
The assignment itself is very simple, I hope.

92
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:37,801
What that requires you to do is get software loaded onto your computer and figure out how to deal with the mechanisms for turning homework in, which you probably know better than I do.

93
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,333
But leave time to figure all this stuff out.

94
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:53,812
What this means is that you should be doing this right now so that when things start going wrong you can ask for help and you can try to figure out what to do to get things to work for you.

95
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,617
To that end, there are office hours.

96
00:08:56,717 --> 00:09:04,125
Both Joe, the teaching assistant, and I will have office hours on Tuesdays because the homework is going to be due on Thursdays.

97
00:09:04,306 --> 00:09:06,658
I think that's the most effective way of running it.

98
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:14,618
Joe will be here but I'm not sure in what room yet.

99
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:18,237
The room number, I think, might be changing, but he will be here from 2:00 to 3:00 on Tuesdays.

100
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:23,303
I will be here after classes on Tuesdays, which will be when I find everyone most exhausted.

101
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:26,740
Anyway, that's another possible way to find out what's going on.

102
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:35,696
The course has a textbook, sort of.

103
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:41,576
Again, the textbook is -- where did I put it?

104
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:54,288
The textbook is online, and it doesn't look like a book, but here's a PDF version and a PostScript version, and then there's a nice HTML version.

105
00:09:54,492 --> 00:10:03,025
You can even download a nice tarball with the HTML version, and you can download all the examples that are described in the book, which are patches in PD.

106
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:15,137
Or you can download -- don't do this -- download all the figures in the book, which are also patches in PD, if you really want to laugh at what Pd can do.

107
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:16,915
It would be hard to do it quick.

108
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,375
So that is textbook, and what I'm going to try to do, although I've been-- Yeah?

109
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:22,826
Student:  What's the website?

110
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:24,412
Oh. What's the website?

111
00:10:24,512 --> 00:10:25,512
The URL is here.

112
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:35,502
That's the URL you want.

113
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:42,865
Although, you can get there very easily because you Google "Puckette" and then you see Courses, and then you see the first one is Music 171.

114
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:54,702
I didn't want to insult your intelligences by printing out the syllabus.

115
00:10:54,981 --> 00:11:01,272
Well, actually, if you have trouble accessing the web, come see me and I'll print you out a copy.

116
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:03,742
But it won't help you so much because it's going to change.

117
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:18,841
On that subject, I want to not forget to say one thing, which is if you don't have easy access to a computer and/or the network, please come see me after class today so that we can figure out how to get that solved.

118
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:22,336
There are various things that we can do to try to get you to a computer.

119
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:26,390
I don't know what it's going to be yet because we'll just have to do it case by case.

120
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:33,054
The polls say that 99 percent of students now have computers, so I'm going to assume that you do until you tell me that you don't.

121
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:41,023
If you don't, do please come tell me because otherwise you will be in serious trouble, and it is fixable.

122
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:47,920
OK, so that's the course web page.

123
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,487
The next thing, this is what you know more about than I do.

124
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,922
The system for turning in assignments is WebCT, which probably all of you have suffered through.

125
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:02,295
Right?  Yeah.

126
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,281
I last touched this in 2004, and it was a real bear

127
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:08,984
I think they've made it a little better now.

128
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:11,780
It's actually better than anything else that I've seen.

129
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:23,570
The reason it has to exist at all, as opposed to just having everyone put homework up on a wiki, is because legally we're not allowed to let other people see your homework assignments.

130
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,625
The whole thing is basically just to protect confidentiality, as far as I can tell.

131
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,628
There's no other reason to have all this infrastructure.

132
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:33,217
In fact, I would love it if one of you could try this

133
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:41,186
If one of you who actually is online, if you could actually go to WebCT and see if you can log in to the course

134
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:46,731
So this is the WebCT login

135
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:51,578
Actually, I think you do webct.ucsd.edu.

136
00:12:51,811 --> 00:12:55,492
It's not going to do this for you what it does for me.

137
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:56,958
Student:  It's not showing up.

138
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:58,058
It's not showing up?

139
00:12:58,242 --> 00:12:59,242
In what sense?

140
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:02,855
Student:  : After you log in it tells you what classes you have on WebCT

141
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:04,160
It's not on that page.

142
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
And you don't have 171 as one of your classes?

143
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Student:  Not yet.

144
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:11,197
OK. I was worried about that because I asked for the class roster and I got not a single student in it.

145
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:22,521
I have to call in to WebCT to ask them if there's something that I should have been doing that I haven't done yet, which is probably going to turn out to be the reason.

146
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,801
Sorry.

147
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:33,612
So this is not going to be an urgent issue until a week from Thursday when it's time to actually upload stuff because I'm not using WebCT to make stuff available to you.

148
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,501
I'm just using it to collect stuff.

149
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:44,657
So for this week, the thing that really is urgent is another thing that I hope some of you will try because maybe this will fail, too.

150
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:50,668
Which is see if you can download Pd and get it to run.

151
00:13:50,901 --> 00:14:03,017
This is going to be a little bit less obvious because I'm going to have to show you some things before you can find out whether you're even successfully running PD.

152
00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:05,692
So go back and say something I didn't say.

153
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:13,503
There is a software package that you will be using for the course which is Pure Data, or PD, and you get it from my website.

154
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,285
It will run on your computer, unless you have something really strange.

155
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:28,555
It will even run on your iPhone, but that version of it is not on my website for that one.

156
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:29,974
I'll tell you if you care.

157
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,265
You can run on Android, too.

158
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:39,746
So you can have a lot of fun with this, but right now we're just going to be using the standard one on the computer and making things easy.

159
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,635
So to do that, you do this.

160
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,732
Or there's several things you can do.

161
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:48,833
I'm going to show you what I normally do, but your mileage may vary.

162
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:57,920
The link is on the website, although you can also find this through my home page if you want to do that.

163
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:03,280
There's all this good stuff, and here is Pure Data.

164
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:13,392
You can be conservative and use version 42, which works, or you can have fun and use version 43, which sort of works.

165
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,472
But which does all sorts of new stuff.

166
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:30,029
There's one thing I know that doesn't work in 43 which you're not going to get for another week, so I will try to fix that by the time you get it.

167
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:34,829
Anyway, I'll tell you with this one I can, which is when I told you what the object is that doesn't work right.

168
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:40,234
Anyway, I'm going to be using 43. In fact let's just do this.

169
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:53,749
If you have a Macintosh that's more than six years old, you will want this funny version.

170
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:57,990
Otherwise, you will want one of these, Mac OSX.

171
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:09,454
Can I ask for a show of hands, this is just out of curiosity, well, actually it matters somewhat but mostly curiosity, how many of you have, as your primary computer, a Macintosh?  Wow.

172
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:18,261
OK, how many of you have the primary computer of a PC running Windows software?

173
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:25,950
OK, so maybe 80 to 20, something like that.

174
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,581
How many of you are running something else?

175
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:31,216
One, two, three.  Very good.

176
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:45,616
The reason I brought the Macintosh today -- actually there are two reasons -- the honest reason is that a Linux box doesn't have DVI out so I'm kind of stuck with it now on compatibility mode.

177
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:53,726
The other reason is that I want to look like you guys are looking today, but then by Thursday you're going to be watching me play with Linux instead of OSX.

178
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,012
All of the OSX lore, unless I decide really to punish you and bring the PC in.

179
00:16:58,204 --> 00:16:59,742
We'll see.

180
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,568
No promises though.

181
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:06,182
We're going to be Macintosh today.

182
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:12,237
We're going to grab PD, the scary one, and I think...

183
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:15,505
I don't know what you do with these things.

184
00:17:15,986 --> 00:17:18,869
Let's just tell it...  I know.

185
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:29,634
I usually save it, and then I get into a shell, and then I type TAR, space, XZF, space, blah, blah.

186
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:35,593
You probably don't want to know how to do that so I'm going to try to pretend I'm a regular computer user.

187
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:42,610
One of you is trying this, right, so that you can see if it's actually working?

188
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,012
What did it do?

189
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,953
Student:  I don't know.

190
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:50,107
I think I just...

191
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:51,491
I thought it opened?

192
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,278
Student:  No, your window just froze.

193
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,162
See I just did that.

194
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,450
It already did that to somebody already.

195
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Student:  It's in the new Balance folder, I think.

196
00:17:58,853 --> 00:17:59,853
What is that?

197
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,295
It probably threw it either on the desktop or in the home drive.

198
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,794
Oh, I'm running PD.

199
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,677
Oh, look.

200
00:18:06,446 --> 00:18:12,021
It looks like I've got all this good stuff and now I don't know which of these is the one I just downloaded.

201
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:14,135
Student:  Right there.

202
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,154
Let's get maybe this one.

203
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:17,692
Student:  Left hand side, left hand side.

204
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:18,941
This must be it right here.

205
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:20,671
All right, this is the one that I had to start with today.

206
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:25,093
Sorry, I don't think it will hurt you to have more than one.

207
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:27,688
Then you just do this.

208
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,301
That's the easy part and then maybe this will happen, maybe not.

209
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:39,702
One thing that I've noticed, the first time you do this on any computer, sometimes it seems to take 30 seconds for Pd to start up.

210
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:47,391
So if you click it and it does nothing for 30 seconds, I don't know what that is, but that's Steve Jobs doing that for you.

211
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,506
Student:  Will Pd Extended work?

212
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:50,563
Yes.  Oh, thank you.

213
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:59,694
Another thing that you can do, which will be more fun, is go get Pd Extended as opposed to Pd PD.

214
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,520
In fact, it's so much fun I'm going to do this for you, too.

215
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:06,999
The problem is I've forgotten where the...

216
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:08,248
Oh, so we just do...

217
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:10,555
Get in the browser, and then we say, Pd Extended.

218
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:24,780
PD Extended, Pure Data downloads, Pd community site.

219
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:32,469
I don't know what the difference is between that and that.

220
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:49,674
This is the redoubtable Hans-Christoph Steiner, who is a person who aggregates-- well, does many, many things for Pd including actually spearheading PD's Release 43. But he's also making the so-called Pd Extended installers.

221
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:56,883
For those of you who know what's going on with Pd and/or Macs, they have various kinds of objects in them.

222
00:19:57,171 --> 00:20:02,842
PD itself ships with a couple hundred objects, and Pd Extended ships maybe with a couple thousand objects in it.

223
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:09,281
So you have lots and lots and lots more stuff to play with in Pd Extended, if you can figure out where to find it.

224
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:13,607
Once in a while I actually reach...

225
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:16,010
You know, I don't want to make a Butterworth filter.

226
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,220
They've got Butterworth filters in it.

227
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:25,044
So there are things which you care about which you can get in Pd Extended that are sometimes really worth getting.

228
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:38,981
The other thing about that is when you want to make graphics, Pd has an extension called GEM, the Graphics Environment for Multimedia, which will allow you to make graphics and also to shoot video and analyze it.

229
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:42,729
Basically do with video the same things that Pd will do with audio.

230
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:46,478
It's not really part of this course, but Pd Extended has that.

231
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,073
You can go make movies or whatever you want to do with it.

232
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:54,456
I'll show you a little bit of that just as a teaser in week 10 when we're reaching out a little bit in the subject.

233
00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:57,051
So, Pd Extended.

234
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:05,797
The last time I did this it was very easy, so I'm hoping this will still be here.

235
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:12,237
So download Pd 42. This is the one that works.

236
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:16,082
PD Extended 43 is up there somewhere, too.

237
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:22,810
So if you want Pd Extended in its natural state, you can do that.

238
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:31,940
But anyway, I think what I do is click this, and it says, "Go to virtual online application."

239
00:00:00,-40 --> 00:00:00,-40
Oh, yes.

240
00:21:38,284 --> 00:21:39,341
I want to open it with...

241
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:42,071
Oh, it's a disc.

242
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,376
I'll say something interesting for 38 seconds.

243
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,489
Actually I sort of know this is going to work because I already have one of these things.

244
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:56,489
It worked the first time.

245
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:05,773
Meanwhile, nothing will happen until... Now it's doing a clean-up. ...

246
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:09,906
All right, we're done.

247
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:25,092
So disc images are things you click on like anything else in that.

248
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,051
New? OK, I'll leave.

249
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:58,156
And ta-da, we have a disc that consists of, well, no one.

250
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:04,019
As it starts, you can ignore it.

251
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,344
It's quick when I do it directly.

252
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:15,168
So this is the Pd Extended application and I didn't do that, I just did this.

253
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:24,684
Why? Because you don't really want to throw stuff into your applications folder.

254
00:23:26,702 --> 00:23:32,565
I won't explain all the reasons you shouldn't mess with your applications folder.

255
00:23:33,526 --> 00:23:34,968
You'll have to guess.

256
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:42,369
Then it takes too long to do runs.

257
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,905
This is all the stuff that it either loaded or didn't load, and that's good.

258
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:50,539
But now we're running Pd Extended.

259
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,017
More about that later if you want to find out about that.

260
00:23:56,402 --> 00:24:01,400
Let's get out of here now and get back to being vanilla.

261
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:07,167
Take that, get rid of it, take that, get rid of it.

262
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,473
Get rid of this.

263
00:24:15,857 --> 00:24:18,220
It's all free so you can throw it away any time you want.

264
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
So, next step.

265
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:24,938
Now you've downloaded PD.

266
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:26,380
Has anyone actually done this?

267
00:24:28,494 --> 00:24:31,474
So, next step is, see if it's working for you.

268
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:38,779
Of course, it should start when you click it and it should also make sound when you ask it to make sound.

269
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:42,719
Actually, that's the real step that means you're doing computer music.

270
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:49,159
To do that, to find out whether that's happening, there are two places that you should think about looking.

271
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:52,619
I always go to the impatient place first.

272
00:24:52,719 --> 00:25:01,846
The impatient place is, go to Media and say "test audio and midi" and up comes a Pd patch.

273
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:17,321
This is a Pd document, first one you've seen so far I guess, and this has indicators that say whether sound was coming in to your computer.

274
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:22,030
These are numbers and decibels which you learned about in musical acoustics last quarter.

275
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:25,491
These are in decibels with 100 being full blast.

276
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:32,219
I don't have a microphone so this is the noise level on the audio input device in my computer.

277
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:33,949
There's nothing plugged in.

278
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:39,235
So, I have a signal-to-noise ratio of, compute that and it's...

279
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:46,251
Student:  Four minus.

280
00:25:47,789 --> 00:26:00,092
So the loudest signal I could get would be 100 here and I'm looking at 28. So the signal-to-noise ratio is 100 minus 28, which is 72. Which, there's not audio hardware supplied.

281
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:02,110
That's bad.

282
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:03,744
Now the other thing that you want to know...

283
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,378
OK so, but sound is coming in.

284
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,012
I like to seeing that better than I like seeing zero.

285
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:11,530
What I really like seeing is one or two, which means I've got decent audio hardware.

286
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:21,237
Now I can make sound, which is to say I can ask the test tone to go on, and this is in decibels too, again, with 100 being full blast.

287
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:24,313
So a good place to start is 60.

288
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,176
Now you hear a nice A440. Or here's 80.

289
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:34,790
I always do 60 first because you never really know where the speakers are set.

290
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:36,424
While I was...

291
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,673
Yeah, there it was.

292
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:49,784
Now, what I didn't show you was, before most of you came in, I connected my computer to the audio system in this room along with the projector.

293
00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:55,454
So what you're hearing now is the computer's line output... talking to my stereo.

294
00:26:55,554 --> 00:27:00,549
And any of you who has a stereo can do the same thing, and that's a better way.

295
00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:05,643
That or headphones would be a better way to operate than using the little speakers that are on the computer.  ... Yeah?

296
00:27:05,931 --> 00:27:07,949
Student:  Did you say the lower the number the better?

297
00:27:08,622 --> 00:27:10,544
Well here, yeah.

298
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:13,140
If there's nothing plugged in, the lower the number the better.

299
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,945
But if you have a laptop, your laptop might have a microphone.

300
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:24,385
So you might not just be looking at the electrical noise level on your equipment, but you might actually be looking at sound.

301
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:27,749
If that's the case, then when you say things that number goes, up.

302
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:34,862
Then you get really happy because you got audio and then you can start making cool processing actions.

303
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:44,377
I'll say that this will happen to you, the first audio process you actually make will suffer from horrible feedback if you're using the microphone with speakers on the...

304
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:46,011
Yeah, like that.

305
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:50,144
Because the mike is very close to the speaker, right?

306
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:53,604
And so the sound comes out of the speaker and back through, like that.

307
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:57,737
If you want to control that, plug in a pair of headphones, which usually will mute the microphones.

308
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:03,312
Then you can listen to what it's doing and the microphone will work properly, I think.

309
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:06,291
Depends on, you know, your mileage may vary.

310
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:15,999
The other thing, just telling you about this, I want to just tell you the basics about getting started.

311
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:17,633
When you do this... and that happens, it's great.

312
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:20,612
But it's possible to do this and not have the sound coming out.

313
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:30,897
Then there are things that you might want to do to figure out why, whether you have sound or not, and that all is here, under PD.

314
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:35,703
So this window popped up when I set the test audio and midi.

315
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:40,028
By the way, this will be possible to do but not useful.

316
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:43,103
I could have two of these up at once and they'll be fighting each other.

317
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:44,449
So don't do that.

318
00:28:44,737 --> 00:28:50,697
So then in PD, that was in media, audio and midi.

319
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,848
In PD, you get preferences which have audio settings.

320
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,155
We're not going to talk about midi today.

321
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:09,439
And audio settings are what sample rate we're running at and a magical number, which I should tell you about, and what audio devices, and what number of channels.

322
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:14,245
Now I can do things that will cause everything to break.

323
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:17,032
Let's have eight channels about right here.

324
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:22,415
All of a sudden, nothing happens.

325
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:25,683
Maybe, I hope, I have an error message.

326
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:27,509
I have lots of error messages.

327
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:32,699
It didn't even give me the proper error message so I can't do it.

328
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:38,274
So this is the "can't do it" mode.

329
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,965
You don't see anything here and you don't hear anything coming out.

330
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,464
That just means that your audio device didn't get opened.

331
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,885
That could happen for all sorts of reasons, which are hard to disambiguate.

332
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:51,441
But in that case it was me asking for something impossible like that.

333
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:58,362
Also if I ask for megahertz out, I don't think it's going to agree.

334
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:02,206
Can't do that.

335
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:04,801
So you have to ask for something reasonable.

336
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:11,433
And the standard CD sample rate is 44K1.

337
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:18,738
Now we're back to being happy with the input now.

338
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:24,505
The other thing that can go wrong is you could...

339
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:29,503
You can't make it not be happy right now.

340
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:33,732
You can have this thing dialed in on a device that is no longer plugged into your computer.

341
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:38,826
You buy a USB audio device, you plug it in, you tell Pd to use it.

342
00:30:38,826 --> 00:30:43,824
Then you unplug the device, it no longer exists, Pd starts up, you can't find it.

343
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,861
Then you see here it's just a little circle which has nothing in it.

344
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:51,898
You just have to click on that and select the thing that you really want.

345
00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:08,045
The other thing that I want to tell you is this number here, the delay, this is the spooky setting that matters but which is hard to figure out how to deal with.

346
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:14,869
This is a number which is 80 milliseconds or up, if you're using Bill Gates' software.

347
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:21,021
Or it's 20 to 30 if you're using whatever his name is, Bill Jobs', Steven Jobs' thing.

348
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:25,827
Or you can get it down to about 10 on Linux.

349
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:32,362
This is the amount of time that passes between when sound comes in the machine and when it comes back out.

350
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:42,743
And if you try to make this too low, Pd shouldn't be showing you errors, which I'll see if I can find here.

351
00:31:42,843 --> 00:31:44,473
Do you hear that?

352
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:51,009
Let's see here.

353
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:01,197
I'm running 43. On 42 you would see a red light saying digital IO errors.

354
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:06,772
I'm trying to resize the window.

355
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:08,843
It's too big for this stuff.

356
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:13,500
Can't do it. ... No, it's not there.

357
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
All right.  Never mind.

358
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,056
I don't know where you see the error.

359
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:18,786
You just hear the error.

360
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,477
Here it is.

361
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:30,320
And that's because I asked for a delay that is smaller than my hardware can provide.

362
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,434
Oh, I did a 15 and now it's cleaned.

363
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:35,510
But now let's see if we can do 15 to 1.

364
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:42,142
So the smaller that number is, the faster the tablet.

365
00:32:41,854 --> 00:32:48,774
That matters because you don't want to do something to your computer and then wait a second before you hear the output.

366
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:56,367
You want it to happen as -- Well, you want to have it happen with a small enough delay that it sounds like it's happening at the same time.

367
00:32:56,467 --> 00:33:03,576
Which, depending on your musical chops and which instrument you play, might vary between five and 30 milliseconds.

368
00:33:04,152 --> 00:33:18,089
What this means is that Macintosh latency's 15 to 20 milliseconds, maybe, or 25, are barely acceptable and the Window's latencies that you get are basically unacceptable.

369
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:24,241
And I can tell you that that's only the built-in audio hardware on those devices.

370
00:33:24,241 --> 00:33:30,296
I have seen Windows boxes get very little latency by professional audio hardware you put on it.

371
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,390
So if you're a real gear-head and want to buy the gear, you can gear your way out of the problem.

372
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:46,828
Although you can also just take this, plug it into your machine, and turn it into Linux, which is what I would do.

373
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:58,554
Sorry to belabor all this, but this is important because you have like eight days, nine days to get this all happening and be turning in homework.

374
00:33:58,457 --> 00:34:02,398
So I want to make this as painless as humanly possible.

375
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,128
Questions about all this?

376
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,474
I know I've forgotten things.

377
00:34:05,574 --> 00:34:06,574
... Yeah?

378
00:34:06,674 --> 00:34:09,703
Student:  So what you're telling me is that the latency...

379
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:12,298
Which one's the latency?

380
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,816
Like between Windows and Mac, is it the hardware on there or the processing speed?

381
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:22,679
No, it's certainly not the hardware because you can fix the problems by loading Linux on the same hardware.

382
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:39,114
I can't even generalize and tell you something that's really true in every possible case, but in some sense the audio...

383
00:34:39,214 --> 00:34:47,009
Well, audio systems consist of layers of stuff on top of stuff-- the driver and the API and the Pd itself --

384
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:55,825
and they all have various amounts of buffering they do, buffering meaning the amount of memory that they allocate in order to deal with being on time with everything.

385
00:34:55,925 --> 00:35:01,874
So when you write something to a computer's audio output, you don't just write the next sample that has to go out.

386
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:09,871
You write several or many milliseconds in advance so that the audio hardware can be throwing them out while you're off thinking about email or something.

387
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:15,305
So that then, when you get back to writing a sample, you're still ahead of what it's doing.

388
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:21,354
So there is a first in/first out buffer sitting in your audio output driver.

389
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:27,608
It's throwing stuff out here, and you're preparing stuff for it to throw out, and you're staying ahead.

390
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:34,067
But you're stopping every once in a while because the OS is not treating you right and it is still reading.

391
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:38,578
If it reads something before you wrote it, then you will hear bad noise.

392
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,218
In fact you'll exactly this kind of bad sound now.

393
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:44,114
In general, you'll hear this sort of bad noise I'm just giving you.

394
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:51,085
This is a paradigmatic sound.

395
00:35:56,827 --> 00:36:09,129
So why would one operating system or one audio application program interface require more buffering than another?

396
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:19,382
You have make enough buffering to deal with whatever your operating system can do for you, in terms of calling you back in short periods of time, and that is in OS.

397
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:27,994
But also, different writers of audio software are sometimes more or less conservative in the way they design these things.

398
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:30,352
So in truth, Windows is overdesigned.

399
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:35,683
It could be a great deal racier, maybe one time in a million, fail.

400
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:40,091
They can't fail one time in a million because they'll get phone calls.

401
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:43,270
So they just make the buffer real long so the phone doesn't ring.

402
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,473
So, there's that.

403
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,033
Now I can start doing stuff, I think.

404
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:59,595
Are there questions before I actually start doing stuff?

405
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:10,360
So do, please, before Thursday, get this downloaded and running so that you're not discovering that you can't do your homework next weekend or something.

406
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,948
So next thing is this, what is this thing good for?

407
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:24,200
So what I am going to do is make a patch that makes a sound.

408
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:32,812
Then I'm going to go back and do some theory, simply because I think it might be better to see the thing happen first and then make a theory out of it.

409
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:40,091
So what I am doing also is I'm simultaneously surreptitiously teaching you how to use pure data.

410
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:44,090
The real content, of course, isn't Pure Data.

411
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:52,804
It's the technique of audio synthesis processing and analysis, which in fact you could do in software packages other than PD.

412
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:58,033
If you want to know about lots of possible software packages, I know them all.

413
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:03,056
I can tell you all sorts of stuff you can do with a computer, in some other context.

414
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:10,131
I am going to just select a ridiculous font to start with.

415
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:18,025
The basic thing you do is you put stuff on the screen so there's this nice menu I can click.

416
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:25,201
What I am going to do today is going to be limited to two kinds of things that you can put down.

417
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:27,047
One is going to be objects.

418
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:30,943
Of course, that really means 200 different things because I have to type in what kind of objects they're going to be.

419
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,916
So that's going to be where I live most of the time.

420
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:38,427
The other thing is I'm going to need a button later on.

421
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,682
So first off, I'm going to make an object.

422
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:43,758
It shows up and I can...

423
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:47,039
Here's the thing.

424
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:51,755
This has a dotted outline that says that there's nobody in there right now.

425
00:38:51,652 --> 00:38:57,701
In fact, if I tell it, let's be some object that doesn't exist, it'll still say, "Nah, there's nobody there."

426
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:02,110
In fact, it even got mad at me.

427
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,288
Now I'll just ask it to do something it knows how to do.

428
00:39:05,288 --> 00:39:10,414
There's an oscillator, and oscillators take as an argument...

429
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,565
So I'm going to ask it to play A.

430
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:22,614
So you've had musical acoustics and you all know that 440 hertz is A above middle C, right?

431
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:27,228
That's one of those physical constants, like the speed of light, that people just don't touch.

432
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,278
You just have that.

433
00:39:29,688 --> 00:39:33,584
Now we're going to say what amplitude we want.

434
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:35,885
So I'm going to put in another object.

435
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,211
I'm doing this in the slow way now.

436
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:38,653
I'll show you the fast way later.

437
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,478
Put another object and put it down here.

438
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:52,839
Then I'm going to type times tilde, I should say, and ask it, let's only be a tenth of a hold for the blast sine wave.

439
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:58,837
I'm going to crack the book in a moment and show you in waveforms what we're talking about here.

440
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:06,622
But for right now just talking over this, this is putting out a full blast 440 hertz sine wave.

441
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:15,849
By the way, you might know this intuitively, but these things are inputs up here and this is an output.

442
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:20,693
I'm going to hook the output of the oscillator to the input of times 0.1.

443
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:29,459
What that is going to do is it's going to take the amplitude of this and reduce it from full blast to a tenth of full blast.

444
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:30,728
What's full blast?

445
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:43,876
100. Then I'm going to say put another object and this one is going to be -- this is kind of not well named -- it's going to be the digital analogue convertor.

446
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:50,451
That's the person in your computer who takes those numbers and turns them into voltages.

447
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,219
Now I'm going to say...

448
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,160
Oh, wow, it just worked.

449
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,253
Take the output of this thing and put it into speakers.

450
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:08,616
That's to say make it available to the audio output of my computer, which by the way is connected to the speaker.

451
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:13,345
Now how do I make it shut up?

452
00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:22,457
There's this control here which says whether you're computing DSP or not.

453
00:41:22,557 --> 00:41:29,204
DSP, I don't know if that's a good name, is digital signal processing, and that turns the network on and off.

454
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:36,413
That's the fastest way to get silence if something's happening too loud.

455
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:42,584
That's important so there's a key accelerator: The slash turns it on and period turns it off.

456
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:48,524
Oh, command slash is on and command period is off, which you can think of as mute.

457
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,387
It's not really mute, but you can think of it that way for now.

458
00:41:54,290 --> 00:42:01,788
Now the other thing that I should have mentioned is that when you start PD, this thing is turned off.

459
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:15,167
The reason it was on just now is not because I surreptitiously turned it on, but because the test tones, which I've already had out, automatically turns the DSP on so that it can make noise.

460
00:42:15,686 --> 00:42:21,222
As a result, I was using the fact that DSP was still running, even though I'd closed the test tone.

461
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:26,643
So this thing stays on regardless of whether I have the patches open or shut.

462
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:31,141
I can close this patch and it won't change the status of whether DSP was running or not.

463
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:35,178
So this is more software.

464
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:38,696
No, this is half software and half theory now.

465
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:55,535
DSP running, what that means is every object whose name ends in a tilde, if DSP is running, is computing 44,100 numbers per second.

466
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:59,687
Or a number of numbers per second equal to the sample rate, I should say.

467
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:01,533
But 44K1 in and out.

468
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:14,681
What that means is that when this is turned on, this output contains a stream of numbers, one every 44,100th of a second.

469
00:43:14,681 --> 00:43:16,815
Let's say one every 22 microseconds.

470
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,063
And furthermore, each of one these things is doing that.

471
00:43:22,063 --> 00:43:23,159
It's using all of its inputs.

472
00:43:23,274 --> 00:43:26,100
It's receiving inputs at the same rate.

473
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:30,482
If nothing is connected to one of these inputs, the input is...

474
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,115
All right, that's a complexity.

475
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:41,613
If nothing is coming to an input that expects audio, the input is zero.

476
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:57,875
I'm going to have to repeat in several different ways distinctions between these streams of audio and things which happen sporadically, which sometimes we call "control" or "not audio."

477
00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:04,796
But what you're seeing right now is connections between the audio output of the oscillator and the audio input.

478
00:44:06,584 --> 00:44:12,004
And what you have to know is this input expects audio and this input expects not audio.

479
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:15,522
It expects messages, which I will tell you about later.

480
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:28,959
So this network is -- I should say, these connections are like carrying numbers when it's turned on and they're not carrying numbers when it's turned off.

481
00:44:29,247 --> 00:44:32,708
This input actually does expect an audio.

482
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:35,418
It expects this audio signal.

483
00:44:35,822 --> 00:44:40,608
For instance, if I have this on I can break this.

484
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:47,355
To cut a connection, select the connection, which turns it blue, then hit command X.

485
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:57,044
So if you want to try the other output, do that, or both.

486
00:44:57,678 --> 00:44:59,639
You can have fan out if you want.

487
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:05,175
While we're at it, you can have fan in.

488
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:11,000
What's the interval between this frequency and that frequency?

489
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:13,480
Any takers?

490
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:16,824
What's the ratio between those two numbers?

491
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:19,420
Three to two.

492
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:22,245
And that's what interval on the piano or musical scale?

493
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,091
Yes, a fifth.

494
00:45:27,378 --> 00:45:41,449
Ta-da, mathematics turned into music! So the reason I did that was not to tell you what a fifth was, but just to show that you can hook two people into an audio input and it will just add them for you.

495
00:45:45,255 --> 00:45:50,503
Over here, here's another thing you can do to demonstrate psychoacoustics effects.

496
00:45:55,463 --> 00:46:00,307
All right, so I'm going to shut this up and talk a little bit more.

497
00:46:01,057 --> 00:46:04,459
Is this all clear, what I've done so far?

498
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:13,283
To do this, basically you do what you do with a computer, which is you sort of flail with stuff and find out what it does.

499
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:17,839
But let me do a little bit of the flailing for you so that you can expect things to happen when they do.

500
00:46:20,664 --> 00:46:22,567
The most confusing thing that will happen is this.

501
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:29,545
You will reach to move something, like this, and it will move.

502
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:31,621
And you will be happy.

503
00:46:32,198 --> 00:46:34,678
Then you will release it and then you will click it again.

504
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:38,023
Then you won't be able to move it anymore.

505
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:42,829
It won't move.

506
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,482
Now I'm editing the text.

507
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:47,365
What do you do?

508
00:46:47,711 --> 00:46:54,170
Well, if you're in this state, which is editing the text, and if you want to move the thing, deselect it and then move it.

509
00:46:56,246 --> 00:47:01,263
This is second nature to me, but everyone has to do this the first time and it will confuse you for a second.

510
00:47:02,763 --> 00:47:12,682
So you can immediately move something that's not selected, but when you select something, when you release the mouse, the text is selected for you to edit the text, which is more than likely what you're going to want to be doing.

511
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:20,698
But in case you really just wanted to move the thing, then you have to deselect it so that you can move it after you deselect it.

512
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:32,808
Also, you can select something by clicking on it, which selects the text, or you can select something as part of a region, and that doesn't select the text.

513
00:47:32,866 --> 00:47:34,192
That just selects the objects.

514
00:47:34,827 --> 00:47:36,153
Then you can move things.

515
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,902
Am I going too slow?

516
00:47:41,343 --> 00:47:42,900
... Yeah.

517
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:54,896
So also, you can select a single thing as a group using the group selector thing, and again, it just selects the object.

518
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:01,528
Next thing is this.

519
00:48:02,911 --> 00:48:08,563
I want to show you what this actually really is, and to do that I have to introduce two new objects.

520
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:19,347
While I'm at it, I'm going to tell you there is, of course, a key-accelerator for putting an object and it's "command-1", and then I can say "print."

521
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:22,346
This is object number four.

522
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:26,960
So I believe in the first week you're going to see about 10 kinds of objects.

523
00:48:27,306 --> 00:48:31,746
What I try to do is limit it to five a day.

524
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,976
First day is going to be iffy because we're already up to four.

525
00:48:35,264 --> 00:48:42,300
But theoretically, we will not be learning lots of objects all at once, but they will be coming out at a steady rate.

526
00:48:42,473 --> 00:48:50,431
So right now, we've seen the oscillator, OSC tilde, we've seen the multiplier, we've seen the output, and now we've seen print tilde.

527
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:56,659
What I'm going to do is I'm going to show you what the oscillator is doing by hooking it up to the print.

528
00:48:57,005 --> 00:49:09,058
Now logically, the first thing that you would expect this to do would be to print out 44,100 numbers a second, but it turns out that that would choke any computer in the world to try to print that stuff.

529
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:10,788
Plus you wouldn't want to see it.

530
00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:18,401
So instead of doing that, what it does is it waits until you tell it to please print the next glob of data, and it prints it globs at a time.

531
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,803
So now what we're going to do is we're going to put the bang under it, which is a button.

532
00:49:22,495 --> 00:49:23,591
Oh, let me do that slower.

533
00:49:26,128 --> 00:49:30,165
So put, I've been putting objects, but I'm going to put this thing down now.

534
00:49:31,088 --> 00:49:34,433
And it is a thing which...

535
00:49:34,836 --> 00:49:36,970
And now I have to let out more of the truth.

536
00:49:37,547 --> 00:49:40,949
I'm being very careful, trying to let out bits of truth very slowly.

537
00:49:41,122 --> 00:49:47,927
So see now that this line that I connected is only one pixel wide, instead of two pixels wide, where this one is.

538
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:54,559
In other words, these are nice dark lines here, but this is a lighter line.

539
00:49:54,905 --> 00:50:00,384
That is to tell you that this is not carrying an audio signal, but is for control.

540
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:02,575
It's for sending messages.

541
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:11,283
Messages are things which happen at specific times, as opposed to signals or audio signals, which are happening continuously.

542
00:50:13,128 --> 00:50:22,067
The message that this thing sends out is:  Every time you click on it, out comes a message.

543
00:50:24,143 --> 00:50:27,142
The message just tells it to do their thing.

544
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:29,795
In this case, it says do you print, please?

545
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:32,044
What has happened?

546
00:50:32,144 --> 00:50:32,851
Oh, because I have this turned off.

547
00:50:33,178 --> 00:50:34,178
Now I'm going to turn it on.

548
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:36,773
And now it prints out.

549
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:44,500
Every time I whack it, it prints out a new collection of data.

550
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:58,976
So print tilde's job is every time you ask it to, it will print you out the next block of data.

551
00:50:59,149 --> 00:51:08,722
So there's built-in knowledge about what Pd is doing here, which is that Pd doesn't actually really just compute one audio sample at a time.

552
00:51:08,837 --> 00:51:12,240
It computes them in batches of, by default, 64 samples.

553
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:15,527
And let's see if we can get this thing shut off.

554
00:51:21,063 --> 00:51:23,600
It should make a nice space with these numbers printed out.

555
00:51:24,523 --> 00:51:37,152
So this is 64 consecutive numbers of a sinusoid, which is to say, a sine wave, which is the thing coming out of OSC tilde.

556
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:47,937
This is basically the first and most truthful tool at your disposal for finding out what's going on inside of a patch that's doing audio.

557
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:56,529
It's clunky and stupid, because this amounts to about 1.45 milliseconds of sound.

558
00:51:57,625 --> 00:52:01,431
So looking at this wouldn't actually tell you much about what really is coming down in there.

559
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:04,545
But if you tried to see it, it would be too much data.

560
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:08,409
Anyway, you can see that good things are true about this thing.

561
00:52:10,658 --> 00:52:13,196
What's the maximum amplitude?

562
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:15,157
It's about one.

563
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,982
Here's an almost one right there.

564
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:26,229
So what you're looking at is just numbers, but if you graphed them you would see a rising and falling part of a sinusoid.

565
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,149
Now let me get you to the book and show you what this is in a picture.

566
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:39,262
You can make Pd make pictures, but I don't want to teach you how to do that yet because there's too much detail involved.

567
00:52:41,857 --> 00:52:44,741
So I'm just going to provide data off of them .

568
00:52:45,606 --> 00:52:47,567
Where was I?

569
00:52:48,028 --> 00:52:49,239
Don't want to do that.

570
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,007
I want to do this. ... Yeah.

571
00:52:52,107 --> 00:52:52,987
All right, good.

572
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:55,986
So I told you there's a textbook.

573
00:52:56,217 --> 00:52:57,255
This is the textbook.

574
00:52:58,235 --> 00:53:03,137
You can buy this if you want to spend, I think it's $79, and they did a good job of printing it.

575
00:53:03,137 --> 00:53:07,693
But you don't need to buy it because you can just look at it on the web, which is more convenient.

576
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:09,423
But if you want to read it in a hammock, you can buy it.

577
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:14,094
You can spend $80 and buy the thing, or print it out.

578
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:17,035
But don't tell them I told you to print it out.

579
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:29,838
I'm skipping some stuff, which maybe I should go back to, but here's a picture of what a digitized audio sample looks like in graph language.

580
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:37,047
There are two pictures here because this is what you want, in some sense.

581
00:53:37,393 --> 00:53:40,045
What you want to make the speaker cone do is to move like that.

582
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:48,465
The speaker cones live in continuous time wher time isn't split up into trenches of 22 microseconds a hit.

583
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:57,289
So the computer's representation of this, however, is split up into screen time and therefore if you graph it, it would look something like that.

584
00:53:57,346 --> 00:54:01,671
This audio signal has a frequency and an amplitude.

585
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:08,707
This is in fact exactly what would come out if you gave the appropriate frequency to an OSC tilde object.

586
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:12,283
It varies between positive one and negative one.

587
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,743
That has no units.

588
00:54:15,858 --> 00:54:21,625
That's an arbitrary scale.

589
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:35,062
But I should tell you that if you put something that's more than one or less than minus one at your audio output, that's to say if you feed something that's out of that range to DAC tilde, then your computer will not be able to play it correctly.

590
00:54:35,157 --> 00:54:36,157
It will click.

591
00:54:36,446 --> 00:54:41,694
So this is the full audio range of your computer's audio output.

592
00:54:42,386 --> 00:54:43,943
How does Pd know that?

593
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,326
PD just asks the computer, what range do you want to feed your DAC in?

594
00:54:48,499 --> 00:54:50,402
And it normalizes that to one.

595
00:54:53,343 --> 00:55:02,109
The frequency that you would do this at is manifested in how many of these samples it takes for the thing to make an entire cycle.

596
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:03,839
This is all acoustics, right?

597
00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:13,527
In fact, what this is if you give it an equation is one of these things.

598
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:26,041
It's an amplitude times the cosine -- you could use sine, but I'm using cosine here -- of the frequency times the sample number plus a phase.

599
00:55:26,387 --> 00:55:33,711
So if you take one of these things and graph it, you will see something like what you saw graphed down there.

600
00:55:33,884 --> 00:55:46,399
Furthermore, you can change the numbers a, which is the amplitude, or omega, which is the frequency, or phi, which is the initial phase, and you can change the way that it looks in one way or another.

601
00:55:48,532 --> 00:55:55,914
n is the sample number, and that is the horizontal axis here.

602
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,354
I'm insulting your upper intelligence here.

603
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:02,373
This is all it is though.

604
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,179
All you do is you do this and say we'll change that equation and we get all confused.

605
00:56:06,525 --> 00:56:10,850
I've done this for 30 years and it never gets old.

606
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:15,464
So what is omega here?

607
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:21,404
Well omega was enough so that after 20 samples the thing comes around and cycles.

608
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:29,708
So omega is two pi over 20. Omega is the frequency out there.

609
00:56:29,881 --> 00:56:41,818
So N is the number of the sample and this is the thing which controls the frequency, but it's the physical frequency of the thing as an array of numbers.

610
00:56:42,395 --> 00:56:49,373
It's not a heard frequency, and you can convert that to the frequency-frequency by a simple formula.

611
00:56:53,756 --> 00:57:00,042
The frequency you hear is the omega, is the angular frequency is what that's called.

612
00:57:00,273 --> 00:57:05,002
Time and sample rate divided by two pi, and that's how you make a sinusoid.

613
00:57:05,102 --> 00:57:11,460
So if you want it to be louder, change A.

614
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:24,955
Or -- and here's why, for this I have to go back to the patch -- if someone gives you a sinusoid and if you want to change its amplitude, all you have to do is multiply it by the ratio of the two amplitudes.

615
00:57:25,128 --> 00:57:31,299
That is, multiply it by the gain you want, gain meaning the difference between the two amplitudes.

616
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:42,371
So what that means is what is coming out of this equation, what's coming out of this oscillator right now.

617
00:57:42,371 --> 00:58:03,436
Omega is two pi times 440 divided by 44,100, whatever that number is, and a is one.

618
00:58:03,536 --> 00:58:06,534
The amplitude of the output of this thing is one.

619
00:58:06,765 --> 00:58:11,494
So what this is really putting out is the cosine of omega times the n, and forget the phase for now.

620
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,531
Time is just passing and we don't know what the phase is right now.

621
00:58:15,631 --> 00:58:25,854
But if we want to change this amplitude, if I gave you just cosine of omega, if you said, "No, I want 0.1 times the cosine of omega,"

622
00:58:25,954 --> 00:58:37,907
 in other words, I want something with an amplitude of 0.1 instead of one, then the solution is to multiply the thing by 0.1. That multiplies it this way.

623
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,809
It changes the amplitude.

624
00:58:40,098 --> 00:58:41,367
It doesn't do this.

625
00:58:41,635 --> 00:58:42,635
That would be...

626
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:43,270
... Yeah?

627
00:58:43,443 --> 00:58:53,881
Student:  So if you were in your print command, like your oscillators, then just having them separate, would that, instead of going all the way to one and down to negative one, would it just go up to 0.1 and down to negative 0.1?

628
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,630
Yeah.

629
00:58:55,534 --> 00:58:57,283
Thank you, because I actually meant to do that but didn't.

630
00:58:57,514 --> 00:59:05,693
So I think what you're asking is, "What if I just print the output of this?" Right?

631
00:59:05,326 --> 00:59:06,326
Student:  Right.  Yeah.

632
00:59:06,273 --> 00:59:07,273
OK, good.

633
00:59:07,337 --> 00:59:10,433
So it'll do that, and I forgot to turn...

634
00:59:10,686 --> 00:59:12,646
Oh, so nothing happened because the audio is turned off.

635
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:15,553
So I'll turn audio on and it will say, "Oh, I need to print something." ... Yeah, there.

636
00:59:15,742 --> 00:59:18,586
Now what we see is kind of ugly.

637
00:59:18,713 --> 00:59:20,040
I'm sorry the spaces aren't worked right.

638
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:28,888
But what you see is something that's going up to about 0.1. It is 0.9998, instead of one.

639
00:59:29,014 --> 00:59:42,286
So these numbers are these numbers divided by 10. Except that I asked it a different time and so actually they are like them but they're not exactly the same as those divided by 10, some of the phase.

640
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:46,583
Is that all clear?

641
00:59:55,874 --> 01:00:11,231
Now without anything besides those things, what have we got?

642
01:00:11,547 --> 01:00:14,581
We'll do those two.

643
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:23,112
I'm going to raise the total count of objects to five, but not in a very interesting way.

644
01:00:23,428 --> 01:00:25,704
I just need an adder.

645
01:00:28,105 --> 01:00:40,871
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the oscillator and have it be zero plus 440. Let me check if that gives us the same thing. ... Yeah.

646
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:42,704
So this is stupid.

647
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:52,753
There's zero coming in here and we're adding 440 to it, so it comes out here as 440 volts, if this were an analog synthesizer, 440 volt signal.

648
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:58,567
The oscillator then is giving us a signal that's plus or minus one volt, but it's changing 440 times a second.

649
01:00:58,693 --> 01:01:05,013
The reason I did that is so that I can do this, take another oscillator, or get another oscillator.

650
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:08,173
Oh, I'm doing this without telling you what I'm doing.

651
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:14,493
I'm selecting this object without selecting the text and I'm hitting command D, which duplicates it.

652
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:21,888
It duplicates it and leaves it selected without the text selected, so that's very convenient for me to move it.

653
01:01:22,014 --> 01:01:25,048
This one I'm going to say six.

654
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:29,851
And by the way, the machine did sample it, too.

655
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:35,539
Look at this from a different perspective.

656
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,825
Come on.

657
01:01:39,331 --> 01:01:42,554
... Yeah, by the way, let's multiply that by something.

658
01:01:42,654 --> 01:01:43,565
No, let's not yet.

659
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,535
Let's just leave it.

660
01:01:47,862 --> 01:01:50,454
See what we get.

661
01:01:51,465 --> 01:01:53,677
Anyone want to guess what this is going to sound like?

662
01:01:57,543 --> 01:01:58,543
All right, I'll show you.

663
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,800
So it's the oscillator on that.

664
01:02:04,926 --> 01:02:07,391
Oh, I can just connect it and show you.

665
01:02:08,528 --> 01:02:10,740
There is the sinusoid and here is the sinusoid.

666
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,607
Its frequency is changing once a second.

667
01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:17,819
It's going up to...

668
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:27,362
OK, so here's an oscillator and it's going at six cycles per second, and what's its amplitude?

669
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:28,752
Student:  One.

670
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:29,953
One, right.

671
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:50,914
So then when we add 440, out comes not the 440 volts, but a varying voltage which varies from 339 to 441. That variation repeats six times per second because this thing is happening at six cycles per second.

672
01:02:51,988 --> 01:03:01,468
But in fact, to make this an easier thing to hear, I will say let's multiply that by five.

673
01:03:01,658 --> 01:03:04,628
This can be ugly, but we're going to do it.

674
01:03:05,513 --> 01:03:08,041
This will be quite audible.

675
01:03:10,379 --> 01:03:13,350
Not quite as ugly as I want it to be.

676
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:19,733
So now we're varying between 435 and 445 hertz.

677
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:25,294
Now of course, since it's a computer, you can tell it to do anything you want.

678
01:03:31,614 --> 01:03:36,860
It sounds like it's doing two pitches at once, to me anyway.

679
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:41,600
But I'm in a weird place because I'm getting an echo from the speaker sounding.

680
01:03:41,663 --> 01:03:43,938
OK, let's do this.

681
01:03:44,823 --> 01:03:46,150
Or, no...

682
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:52,660
OK, let's not do that.

683
01:03:54,176 --> 01:03:59,043
So it's a computer, it'll do anything you tell it to, if it was a good idea or not.

684
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,306
It doesn't matter to it.

685
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:05,489
And furthermore, it won't hurt you because what comes out won't be more than outside the range of the DAC.

686
01:04:05,615 --> 01:04:13,073
So as long as you don't crank your stereo or your headphones, you won't injure yourself doing this.

687
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:21,352
I think that what's going on here is it changes its speed to vibrato.

688
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:25,081
I need it more to make this obvious.

689
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:29,062
I'm sorry, this is ugly now.

690
01:04:29,252 --> 01:04:33,107
So this is just how fast it's going, once per second, twice per second and so on.

691
01:04:34,244 --> 01:04:36,457
You know what I didn't tell you?

692
01:04:37,215 --> 01:04:44,546
When you start typing in an object like this, it doesn't immediately change it to the new object.

693
01:04:45,178 --> 01:04:51,118
It only does that when you click off of it to deselect the text.

694
01:04:54,531 --> 01:05:00,915
And furthermore, if you do something bad like this and then it would say, oh, I couldn't create that.

695
01:05:01,546 --> 01:05:05,781
Then it prints the dotted line to tell me the object would be bad.

696
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:10,394
But it kept the connection so that I don't have to remake a connection when I fix the problem.

697
01:05:10,584 --> 01:05:18,989
The problem here is that OSC tilde has a name that only works when there's no space in its interior.

698
01:05:19,495 --> 01:05:23,603
For those of you who are computer scientists, space is "the delimiter."

699
01:05:23,982 --> 01:05:29,670
That is essentially the only delimiter that you have to deal with.

700
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:34,852
So don't try to make an object if its name has a space in it.

701
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:43,574
Student:  So just a question about the setup. So the amplitude for the OSC tilde is one, right?

702
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,700
Right.

703
01:05:44,838 --> 01:05:46,607
Student:  And we times it by 30?

704
01:05:46,797 --> 01:05:47,797
Right.

705
01:05:48,314 --> 01:05:52,422
Student:  So that makes the amplitude for the 440 between 410 and 470. Is that right?

706
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:55,898
Right, and that's changing three times a second.

707
01:05:56,277 --> 01:06:00,322
Then that's becoming the frequency for the oscillator.

708
01:06:00,827 --> 01:06:03,418
I didn't tell you something important.

709
01:06:03,545 --> 01:06:11,508
Frequently, objects will give you the choice of specifying their input or connecting to their input to set it.

710
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:18,902
Here I've said "oscillator" which means we're just going to take a signal and specify what our frequency's going to be.

711
01:06:18,902 --> 01:06:22,378
But here I'm saying "oscillator" but I know what the frequency is.

712
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,032
It's three, so I'm just going to keep it on.

713
01:06:25,132 --> 01:06:31,352
There's another way in too, which is that you can change these in messages, but I'm not going to try to tell you that.

714
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:34,576
Student:  Is there a map of all the names of the outputs that we learned?

715
01:06:34,702 --> 01:06:38,431
If you really want to see it, you say Help.

716
01:06:42,981 --> 01:06:55,305
Right-click on it and you can get help and help within a patch, which tells you everything you want to know about it.

717
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,108
OK, so that was help.

718
01:07:00,677 --> 01:07:03,584
So if you want to have multiplier help, you do that.

719
01:07:07,502 --> 01:07:20,837
Then if you right-click on the canvas and say help -- the canvas meaning the document but not any of the objects in the document -- then you will get this lovely patch that someone else made.

720
01:07:21,659 --> 01:07:27,283
It will tell you everything in this very carefully organized order.

721
01:07:27,473 --> 01:07:32,529
But this will only be the first 200 objects, which are the ones that you get before you get Pd Extended.

722
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:35,436
More than one...

723
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:41,239
That's funny.

724
01:07:45,042 --> 01:07:50,225
I didn't see any specific examples but I'm just about sure that there are two copies of this thing here.

725
01:07:57,619 --> 01:07:59,831
Never mind, I'm sorry.

726
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:02,675
There really is this much stuff.

727
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:04,824
Well, sorry, it's just what it is.

728
01:08:05,266 --> 01:08:06,593
Maybe there are more than 200 objects now.

729
01:08:10,701 --> 01:08:13,166
So that will tell you everything that you might need to know.

730
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:20,371
If we're doing 10 a week, at the end of the 10 weeks you'll know 100 of those objects.

731
01:08:23,278 --> 01:08:25,490
You don't need to know them all.

732
01:08:27,323 --> 01:08:30,040
I know them all, but you're not me.

733
01:08:32,063 --> 01:08:36,107
Basically, with about 100 of them, you can do a whole lot of stuff.

734
01:08:36,207 --> 01:08:42,238
And then there will be an occasional thing that you can't do with those 100 that will require that you find another one out and thereabouts.

735
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:46,409
So what happens is that there will be a period of intense learning objects, like 10 a week.

736
01:08:46,409 --> 01:08:51,022
After a while, you won't need 10 new objects, there won't be any more and things will calm down.

737
01:08:53,234 --> 01:08:55,320
Other questions?   ... Yeah?

738
01:08:56,015 --> 01:08:58,606
Student:  How do you get the print thing to work again?

739
01:09:00,692 --> 01:09:07,580
So oh, yeah, there's a thing I didn't tell you, which is fundamental.

740
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,614
The patch can be in two different...

741
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:17,187
The interface of the patch can be in two different states, which are sometimes called run mode or edit mode.

742
01:09:17,629 --> 01:09:25,213
If I try to click this thing now, I'm just editing the patch, and that doesn't click on it.

743
01:09:25,313 --> 01:09:26,983
It just moved it, right?

744
01:09:26,983 --> 01:09:32,354
So what I have to do is put myself into run mode, which I do here.

745
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,566
Let's get out of edit mode.

746
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:39,938
Now edit mode is no longer... Whoops! It is still on.

747
01:09:42,656 --> 01:09:46,069
Well, this is version 43. You tend to get what you pay for.

748
01:09:46,321 --> 01:09:49,734
Anyway, the indication is what the cursor looks like.

749
01:09:49,861 --> 01:09:52,072
So right now what you see is an arrow.

750
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:57,065
And if I do that again, you will see an arrow again.

751
01:09:57,255 --> 01:09:58,266
Like now.

752
01:09:58,456 --> 01:10:01,679
Now it's just being happy.

753
01:10:03,196 --> 01:10:04,902
You cannot get out of edit mode.

754
01:10:06,924 --> 01:10:08,504
That's cool.

755
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:13,181
OK, well, I'm expecting to see stuff like this because we're in pre-release.

756
01:10:13,371 --> 01:10:15,203
Student:  Does the shortcut work, Apple-E?

757
01:10:15,393 --> 01:10:16,404
Oh, the shortcut works great.

758
01:10:16,594 --> 01:10:21,460
So the shortcut, you just hit DSP, command E, or Apple E.

759
01:10:21,587 --> 01:10:30,624
And then it goes back and forth between modes, except that this is a thing that Hans has driven, and just torn hair out of his head over it.

760
01:10:31,003 --> 01:10:34,353
You don't actually see the new state until you move the cursor.

761
01:10:34,669 --> 01:10:42,821
Because some smart person at Apple thought you would never have the cursor change unless you reached it, unless you changed wherever the cursor is.

762
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:48,825
So what you have to do is change the mode, but then you have to jiggle the cursor to see that you are in the other mode.

763
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,078
Isn't that horrible?

764
01:10:50,089 --> 01:10:55,524
That's only on Macintosh, so only 80 percent of you are going to have this trouble like we're having today.

765
01:10:55,624 --> 01:10:56,624
Student:  90 percent.

766
01:10:57,294 --> 01:11:02,097
So anyway, we're just moving to make sure this is what you think it is.

767
01:11:03,487 --> 01:11:09,997
When you're in the run mode, which is not edit mode, you can click this thing and get it to do its thing.

768
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:14,295
And of course, sorry, we also have to turn on audio.

769
01:11:14,547 --> 01:11:17,897
Of course, there's a reason why I'm not on audio.

770
01:11:18,087 --> 01:11:19,414
Let's see.

771
01:11:20,362 --> 01:11:21,942
Let's just do this.

772
01:11:22,384 --> 01:11:26,365
So now we can turn the thing on but not hear it.

773
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:29,020
Now we're running so I can do this.

774
01:11:29,525 --> 01:11:34,518
But if I can get back into edit mode, like this, then I can click it all I want.

775
01:11:34,771 --> 01:11:42,039
Although, sometimes you can hold the command key down and click it.

776
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:45,704
And it will say, it's as if you were in run mode.

777
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:53,604
So the command key operates as a sort of shift into run mode thing, if you can remember that.

778
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:57,270
I never remember it, so I just toggle the mode.

779
01:11:57,649 --> 01:11:58,787
Other questions?

780
01:11:58,976 --> 01:12:00,114
Did that answer yours?

781
01:12:00,556 --> 01:12:01,556
Student:  Yes.

782
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:03,653
... Yeah?

783
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:09,278
Student:  I just want to make sure I understand print and DAC tilde.

784
01:12:09,341 --> 01:12:16,609
Print within run mode, when you click it, it creates a graphical mathematical representation of that patch, is that right?

785
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:18,125
Well, not even graphical.

786
01:12:18,225 --> 01:12:19,895
It just prints the numbers out.

787
01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:23,687
Student:  All right.  And then the DAC tilde, then the time is...?

788
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:28,111
OK, so the dac~, that takes whatever the signal is...  and puts it there.

789
01:12:28,301 --> 01:12:32,472
So it causes it to appear as an audio output.

790
01:12:32,572 --> 01:12:38,097
So this is, print the values out so I can see them, and this is, play them so I can hear them.

791
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:39,992
Student:  Is that abbreviated for something?

792
01:12:40,308 --> 01:12:46,628
DAC?  It's digital-to-analog converter, and that used to be what people called it.

793
01:12:46,818 --> 01:12:51,495
There actually is a DAC in your machine, but people never seem to use that term anymore.

794
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:53,201
So, yeah.

795
01:12:53,517 --> 01:12:54,517
... Yeah?

796
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:55,855
Student:  It only prints the first 64 though, right?

797
01:12:56,045 --> 01:12:58,889
It only prints the next 64, until you whack it.

798
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:02,744
Of course, if you really wanted to...

799
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:08,811
No, never mind. ...  I could ask it to print more.

800
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:09,696
... Yeah?

801
01:13:09,822 --> 01:13:11,782
Student:  Do you have a limit in the inputs and outputs?

802
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:16,079
You mean as to amplitude or the number of includes or....?

803
01:13:16,206 --> 01:13:17,722
Student:  Just how many things you can enter.

804
01:13:17,734 --> 01:13:18,734
Oh, no.

805
01:13:18,923 --> 01:13:20,756
Student:  You can have more inputs than objects?

806
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:23,852
Yeah. Oh, wait.  Add more than just an object, meaning...

807
01:13:24,295 --> 01:13:27,455
I think what your question was, was how many other things could I run into this...

808
01:13:27,555 --> 01:13:27,935
Student:  Right.

809
01:13:28,035 --> 01:13:29,035
...into these fixed objects.

810
01:13:29,161 --> 01:13:32,764
But I can do that and you'd never have to stop.

811
01:13:33,269 --> 01:13:37,061
But could I make the object itself have more inputs?

812
01:13:37,161 --> 01:13:40,411
Each object has its own schematics about what its inputs and outputs mean.

813
01:13:40,411 --> 01:13:45,340
Some of them actually do have variable numbers, but you won't see those for a couple of weeks.

814
01:13:48,311 --> 01:13:49,638
Other questions?

815
01:13:50,396 --> 01:13:52,292
These are good questions, by the way.

816
01:13:52,392 --> 01:13:52,545
... Yeah?

817
01:13:52,671 --> 01:13:56,021
Student:  You said that the right input was an input for messages?

818
01:13:56,084 --> 01:13:59,054
So if you try to put an input, like with an audio, to that, it won't work?

819
01:13:59,154 --> 01:13:59,813
Yeah.

820
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:01,456
Student:  You have to keep it to the left.

821
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:10,241
Yeah. So for these particular objects, the right input is... Yeah, OK.

822
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:14,033
So we'll get there, because there'll be other things where there will be more than one audio input.

823
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,446
Sometimes you'll want to multiply two audio signals or something like that.

824
01:14:17,635 --> 01:14:20,542
And I'd be scared to tell you that right now.

825
01:14:20,795 --> 01:14:22,375
I'll tell you about that on Thursday.

826
01:14:24,271 --> 01:14:27,684
Student:  Is this only one channel right now? Like, left only?

827
01:14:27,784 --> 01:14:29,011
I've only been using the left side, mostly.

828
01:14:29,137 --> 01:14:32,613
When I'm working at home, I use both sides...

829
01:14:32,866 --> 01:14:36,532
because it irritates me to hear every sound out of just one side of the thing.

830
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:40,639
You know, it's just what you like.

831
01:14:41,156 --> 01:14:42,156
... Yeah?

832
01:14:42,409 --> 01:14:46,138
Student:  So there's no spaces unless you put a number in there? You just have the space to put the number?

833
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:46,643
Right.

834
01:14:47,086 --> 01:14:49,550
Student:  Because otherwise you just get the domino effect.

835
01:14:49,803 --> 01:14:51,130
Right. ... Yeah.

836
01:14:51,067 --> 01:14:56,692
One way I can have it fail is to add a space right in one.

837
01:14:56,818 --> 01:14:59,726
So I'd be looking for an object named OSC and I didn't see one.

838
01:14:59,726 --> 01:15:06,678
The other thing I could do wrong would be to not put a space there and so it would look for an object named "osc~3" which doesn't exist.

839
01:15:07,941 --> 01:15:10,090
Student:  Are there any defaults if you don't put a number in there?

840
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:11,986
Yeah, zero.

841
01:15:15,968 --> 01:15:19,760
You can add zero to something, you could multiply by zero.

842
01:15:25,574 --> 01:15:30,061
But if you don't fill that number in, then the other inlet becomes an audio inlet.

843
01:15:30,161 --> 01:15:34,738
Then you can run an audio signal in there instead.

844
01:15:35,686 --> 01:15:37,266
I wasn't going to tell you that.

845
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:46,430
If I just want to just multiply by something else, then I just don't say what multiplies by this thing and then it becomes an audio input.

846
01:15:46,493 --> 01:15:51,486
Then you can be multiplying two of the audio signals.

847
01:15:53,788 --> 01:15:57,423
That's really for next time, but that's the thing you would do.

848
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:01,896
... Yeah?

849
01:16:03,294 --> 01:16:08,327
Student:  Why does the print object not have two inlets?  Why don't you have a data inlet on the right?

850
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:10,424
... Yeah, isn't that stupid?

851
01:16:16,296 --> 01:16:23,566
Inputs to objects can have various functionalities, and one of the particular things that you can send an input is an audio signal.

852
01:16:23,566 --> 01:16:27,620
But there are other things you can send as an audio signal input as well.

853
01:16:29,717 --> 01:16:34,331
Of course if a thing had two different audio signal inputs, then we'd have to have two different inlets in order to be able to disambiguate them.

854
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:43,977
But if it takes two things that are different, like the message in an audio signal, then you get away with these in the same inlet.

855
01:16:44,257 --> 01:16:47,193
If there was less clutter on the screen, you'd just combine them.

856
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:48,311
That's the simple answer.

857
01:16:52,086 --> 01:16:54,602
Other questions?

858
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:59,216
Go look at the homework assignment.

859
01:16:59,316 --> 01:17:01,173
I don't know if my machine is going to be able to play it.

860
01:17:01,453 --> 01:17:03,969
But it's going to be to do this.

861
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:06,206
Firefox...

862
01:17:08,024 --> 01:17:10,820
I don't know if I bookmarked it.

863
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,756
And somewhere down here...

864
01:17:14,455 --> 01:17:20,466
You get your assignment here, which is to do this.

865
01:17:20,746 --> 01:17:23,681
Now I don't know if this is going to play correctly, so...

866
01:17:27,177 --> 01:17:29,134
It's lame.

867
01:17:30,811 --> 01:17:33,188
All it is, is just a musical fourth that gets louder and softer.

868
01:17:34,027 --> 01:17:39,060
It's checking whether you can control amplitudes and frequencies, and understand the difference between them.

869
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:44,372
And it's checking whether you can actually get around the oscillator, and the multiplier, and the adder.

870
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:58,073
Basically what this amounts to is understanding oscillators, frequencies and amplitudes -- and being able to kick Pd on -- which is probably going to be the hard part.

871
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:03,805
Student:  When we turn in homework we'll be turning in all of this?

872
01:18:03,905 --> 01:18:07,400
Oh. To turn the homework in, just upload the patch you made.

873
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:15,535
And I will give you more details about how the patch should act in order to conserve the TA's sanity.

874
01:18:15,635 --> 01:18:19,752
There should be a clear way to turn it on, that sort of thing.

875
01:18:22,175 --> 01:18:24,762
But more about that next time.
