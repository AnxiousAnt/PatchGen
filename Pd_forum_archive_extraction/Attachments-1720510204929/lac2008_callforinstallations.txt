Call for Installation Proposals
===============================
http://lac.linuxaudio.org/download/lac2008_callforinstallations.txt

The conference will include an exhibition of sound art or mixed media
art with a substantial sound portion.  This exhibition will consist of
works by students of the Academy of Media Arts (KHM) Cologne and
artists from outside the KHM.  We are looking for installation
projects with a substantial sound portion which have been entirely or
mostly produced under Linux and/or with open source software for
inclusion in the abovementioned exhibition.

Installation proposals may be designed for a specific presentation
space and/or reflect certain aspects of the exhibition venue.  In
order to give some impressions of the venue, photos of the different
spaces available for the exhibition along with some notes are provided
for download at

Proposals for entirely self-contained and non-site-specific projects
are also welcome.  The submission of proposals for previously
unrealised installations is encouraged, though installations which
already have been shown may also get selected.

The artistic and technical realisation of the selected proposals is
completely up to the artists.  Basic technical support for the
exhibition (electricity, standard network access, limited basic
assistance) is provided by the conference organisers.

Out of all submitted proposals, two projects will be selected for
funded realisation by a jury.  To each of the two selected projects, a
scholarship of EUR 2.000,00 will be granted.  This fee should cover
the entire realisation of the project, material expenses, travel,
accomodation and all further expenses in conjunction with the
realisation of the project.  The selected artists are invited to use
the school's facilities (e.g. laboratories, studios) free of charge
for realising the work.  In case a selected proposal has been
submitted by more than one artist, one person has to be elected by the
team for being responsible for the project, signing the contract and
receiving the money due to legal issues.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to legal issues, the scholarships for the projects
can only be given to non-germans, i.e. to anybody whose nationality is
NOT german.

Further projects might be invited for inclusion in the exhibition but
whithout granting any funding from the conference.

For submission, please use the form provided with the photo material.
