yo, coool down...

you need xvideo if you use the pdp_xv object,
anyway that's strange,
even on crappy boards ( like mine ),
you usually have one xvideo port,
do you have this lines in your XF86Config-4
( alternatively xorg.conf ) :

        Load  "extmod"
        Load  "fbdevhw"
        Load  "glx"

if not, you can try to send the video output to a pdp_glx..

and, if this doesn't work either, use it a support
to read good books )
or you can put music partitions in it )

cheers,
