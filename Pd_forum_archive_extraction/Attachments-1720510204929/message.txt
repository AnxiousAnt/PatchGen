Computer Music Workshop

Max/Msp & Pd Workshop  June 10-15, 1999
Faculty:  Miller Puckette, David Zicarelli, Zack Settel, Erik Ona, &
Cort Lippe

This year, the Computer Music Component of June in Buffalo will offer
a five day, in-depth workshop in Max/Msp & Pd. Max/Msp is powerful,
Macintosh-based software which can be used for the creation of realtime
interactive music and audio plug-ins. PD runs on PC/SGI platforms and
has added functionality for realtime 3-D graphics manipulation. We will
be accepting a maximum of 20 participants for this workshop. Applicants
should include a CV and documentation illustrating any previous
experience.
We encourage applications from beginners and experienced computer
musicians
alike. All applicants are welcome to send computer programs, Max
patches,
csound examples,  and, of course, music with their applications. We can
also accept attachments via email and will be happy to look at web sites

containing appropriate documentation. The workshop will be given at
the Hiller Computer Music Studios, which emphasizes the creation of
interactive computer music using real-time digital signal processing.
(Please note that participants in the Computer Music Workshop who
wish to have a computer music piece performed must apply separately
to June in Buffalo. See www.music.buffalo.edu/composition/jib)
