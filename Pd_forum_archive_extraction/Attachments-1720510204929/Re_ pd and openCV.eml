estimado Loic,

i don't have an idea of what you men by 'Jean Yves implementation'.
i never saw it posted anywhere
and where is the code?

apart from this we try to make things easy for the people
and not a head-breaking library like gridflow is.
and that can only be used by scientifics..

tom schouten already went  in that direction
and i totally disagree with it

ciao,
sevy
