>Subject: New Virus Alert
>>
>> Very Dangerous Virus !!!!
>>
>> A new virus has just been discovered that has been
>> classified by Microsoft ( www.microsoft.com <http://www.microsoft.com>
>> <http://www.microsoft.com <http://www.microsoft.com> > ) and
>> by McAfee
>> ( www.mcafee.com <http://www.mcafee.com>  <http://www.mcafee.com
>> <http://www.mcafee.com> > ) as the most destructive ever!
>> This virus was discovered yesterday afternoon
>> by McAfee and no vaccine has yet been developed. This
>> virus simply destroys Sector Zero from the hard
>> disk, where vital information for its functioning
>> are stored.
>>
>> This virus acts in the following manner:
>> It sends itself automatically to all contacts on
>> your list with the title
>> "A Virtual Card for You".
>> As soon as the supposed virtual card is opened, the
>> computer freezes so that the user has to reboot. When
>> the ctrl+alt+del keys or the reset button are pressed,
>> the virus destroys Sector Zero, thus permanently
>> destroying the hard disk.
>>
>> Yesterday in just a few hours this virus caused panic
>> in New York, according to news broadcast
>> by CNN ( www.cnn.com <http://www.cnn.com>  <http://www.cnn.com
>> <http://www.cnn.com> > ). This alert was received by an
>> employee of Microsoft itself. So don't open any
>> mails with subject
>> "A Virtual Card for You".
>> As soon as you get the mail, delete it.
>> Please pass on this mail to all your friends.
>> Forward this to everyone in your address book. I would
>> rather receive this 25 times than not at all.
>>
>> Also: Intel announced that a new and very destructive
>> virus was discovered recently. If you receive an email
>> called
>> "An Internet Flower For You",
>> do not open it.
>> Delete it right away! This virus removes all dynamic link
>> libraries(.dll files) from your computer. Your computer
>> will not be able to boot up.
