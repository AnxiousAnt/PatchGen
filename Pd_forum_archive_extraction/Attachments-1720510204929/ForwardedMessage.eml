Hi, unfortunately I'm stuck with a soundblaster live s/card. Recently 
getting back into PD and was hoping to make use of the multiple inputs on 
the live drive. However, pd -listdev only brings up Line-in1 & standard 
stereo out. Does anyone know a solution to this or am I stuck with it till I 
get a better soundcard?

PS OS:.... Win98/Mandrake9.1


Thanks to anyone who can help
Dougie McGilvray
