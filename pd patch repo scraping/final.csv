3,DJ/VJ scratching system,DJ/VJ scratching system,"First my story: (you can skip down to END OF STORY if you want)
Ever since I saw Mike Relm go to town with a DVDJ, I've wanted a system where I could scratch and cue video. However, I haven't wanted to spend the $2500 for a DVDJ. As I was researching, I found a number of different systems. I am not a DJ by trade, so to get a system like Traktor or Serrato with their video modules plus turntables plus hardware plus a DJ mixer, soon everything gets really expensive. But in looking around, I found the Ms.Pinky system and after a little bit, I found a USB turntable on Woot for $60. So I bought it. It was marketed as a DJ turntable, but I knew that it wasn't really serious since it had a belt drive, but it came with a slip-pad and the USB connection meant that I wouldn't need a preamp. And so I spend the $100 on the Ms.Pinky vinyl plus software license (now only $80). This worked decently, but I had a lot of trouble really getting it totally on point. The relative mode worked well, but sometimes would skip if I scratched too vigorously. The absolute mode I couldn't get to work at all. After reading a little more, I came to the conclusion that my signal from vinyl to computer just wasn't strong enough, so I would need maybe a new needle or maybe a different turntable and I didn't really want to spend the money experimenting. I think that the Ms. Pinky system is probably a very good system with the right equipment, but I don't do this professionally, so I don't want to spend the loot on a system.
Earlier, before I bought Ms.Pinky (about two years ago), I had also looked around for a cheap MIDI USB DJ controller and not found one. Well, about a month ago, I saw the ION Discover DJ controller was on sale at Bed, Bath & Beyond for $50. They sold out before I could get one, but Vann's was selling it for $70, so I decided that that was good enough and bought one. I had planned to try to use it with Ms. Pinky since you can hook up MIDI controllers to it. But it turns out that you can hook up MIDI controllers to every control except the turntable, so that was a no go. If I had Max/MSP/Jitter, I could have changed that, but that's also way expensive. So, how should I scratch? My controller came with DJ'ing software and there's also some freeware, like Mixxx, but none of this has video support. So I look around and find Pure Data and GEM.
And I see lots of questions about scratching, how to do it. And there are even some tutorials and small patches out there, but as I look at them, none of them are quite what I'm looking for. The YouTube tutorial is really problematic because it's no good at all for scratching a song. It can create a scratching sound for a small sample, but it's taking the turntable's speed and using that as the position in the sample. If you did that with a longer song, it wouldn't even sound like a scratch. And then there are some which do work right, but none of them keep track of where you are in the playback. So, whenever you start scratching, you're starting from the beginning of the song or the middle.
So, I looked at all this and I said, ""Hey, I can do this. I've got my spring break coming up. Looking at how easy PD looks and how much other good (if imperfect) work other people have done, I bet that I could build a good system for audio and video scratching within a week."" And, I have.
END OF STORY
So that's what I'm presenting to you, my free audio and video scratching system in Pure Data (Pd-extended, really). I use the name DJ Lease Def, so it's the Lease Def DJ system. It's not quite perfect because it loads its samples into tables using soundfiler which means that it has a huge delay when you load a new file during which the whole thing goes silent. I am unhappy about this, but unsure how to fix it. Otherwise, it's pretty nifty. Anyway, rather than be one big patch, it relies on a system of patches which work with each other. Each of the different parts will come in several versions and you can choose which one you want to use and load up the different parts and they should work together correctly. Right now, for most of the parts there's only one version, but I'll be adding others later.
There's a more detailed instruction manual in the .zip file, but the summary is that you load:
the engine (only one version right now): loads the files, does the actual signal processing and playback
one control patch (three versions to choose from currently, two GUI versions and a MIDI version specific to the Ion Discover DJ): is used to do most of the controlling of the engine other than loading files such as scratching, fading, adjusting volume, etc.
zero or one cueing patch (one version, optional): manages the controls for jumping around to different points in songs
zero or one net patch (one version: video playback): does some sort of add-on. Will probably most commonly be used for video. The net patches have to run in a separate instance of Pd-extended and they listen for signals from the engine via local UDP packets. This is set-up this way because when the audio and video tried to run in the same instance, I would get periodic little pops, clicks, and other unsmoothnesses. The audio part renders 1000 times per second for maximum fidelity, but the video part only renders like 30 or 60 times per second. Pure Data is not quite smooth enough to handle this in a clever real-time multithreading manner to ensure that they both always get their time slices. But you put them in separate processes, it all works fine.
So, anyway, it's real scratching beginning exactly where you were in playing the song and when you stop scratching it picks up just where you left off, you can set and jump to cue points, and it does video which will follow right along with both the scratching and cuing. So I'm pretty proud of it. The downsides are that you have to separate the audio and video files, that the audio has to be uncompressed aiff or wav (and that loading a new file pauses everything for like 10 seconds), that for really smooth video when you're scratching or playing backwards you have to encode it with a codec with no inter-frame encoding such as MJPEG, which results in bigger video files (but the playback scratches perfectly as a result).
So anyway, check it out, let me know what you think. If you have any questions or feedback please share. If anyone wants to build control patches for other MIDI hardware, please do and share them with me. I'd be glad to include them in the download. The different patches communicate using send and receive with a standard set of symbols. I've included documentation about what the expected symbols and values are. Also, if anyone wants me to write patches for some piece of hardware that you have, if you can give me one, I'll be glad to do it.

5,Plugdata: 3 values Interpolation patch (added Scale version - imo ultra dumb)),Plugdata: 3 values Interpolation patch (added Scale version - imo ultra dumb)),"Hi.
this patch is rather for Plugdata, since Pd imo does not have gate, tough u can use else/router, which is the same.



As a tribute to Omar I've shared a patch using his interpolation technique and update it on 3 values.
There was discussion on this topic on FB too (also deleted, tough) and consensus was, that value offset created when adding nother interpolation is caused by imprecision of slider. I found it is not EDIT ""completely"" true,
Slider in Plugdata is pretty precise.
It is - obviously - cause by leaving the smallest step value in previous approximation, which distorts the final result.
Solution is to send ""0"" to not used part, when interpolating other value..
EDIT: *Tough as mentioned, despite 6 digits are pretty fine (enough for DIY fine-tuning in DAW, without noticeable side-fxs. W/out this there was offset even 1/3 of step - 0.02-4 cca, now it is in 0.5 Hz range - beyond vst synth resolution), but this is definitely not the best suited approach for 12 decimals scala-like Pro fine-tuning etc.. that wont fly



BTW there should be probably even more elaborate solution, for more values - like using append+scale...  if someone would like to beat the efficiency (make it dumber)) contest.. 
Happy patching.
Scale version is - obviously - in comments sesction..

13,Interactive pole-zero-diagram for basic filter design,Interactive pole-zero-diagram for basic filter design,"I've been trying to understand some of the basic principles of filter design lately, and here is a result of my modest first attempts in that field. It's a patch demonstrating the effect of different pole and zero locations by (graphically) calculating the corresponding frequency responses.
pole-zero-diagram.pd
To avoid confusion, I should probably say some things about how the patch actually works ...
Most importantly, I decided to only use complex filters and to arrange them in conjugate pairs to get real valued outputs at every stage within the cascade of elementary filters. Shortcuts as used in [vcf~] (a one-pole complex filter) aren't possible in this kind of implementation. To get the result corresponding to its left outlet (= real output), you would have to place a (real) zero right in the middle between the two (complex conjugate) poles etc.
The patch allows to use up to six (pairs of) poles or zeros, which may be either real or complex. If less poles or zeros are used, the coefficients of the unused filters are simply set to zero (just as the conjugate poles or zeros are set to zero for the real elementary filters).
By the way: In an earlier version of the patch, I also graphed the phase response of the filter, but I dropped that very soon because I thought this wouldn't be too helpful anyway.
Now for the use: The key control options are explained in the patch itself. Apart from that, you can click and drag the poles and zeros or specify each of its five parameters using the number boxes (values are rounded according to the graphic resolution of one hundredth).
The radii of all poles an zeros are clipped to guarantee stability.
Well, that's about it, I guess.

19,Seeking Creative Solutions for MIDI Data Manipulation in Pure Data Extended,Seeking Creative Solutions for MIDI Data Manipulation in Pure Data Extended,"Hello fellow music enthusiasts and tech aficionados,
I hope this message finds you well. I come to you with a puzzle that has been occupying my mind, and I believe your collective wisdom could help me find the missing piece.
As a self-taught musician and tech geek, I have been diving into the world of MIDI data manipulation within Pure Data Extended. My current project involves a web of message objects that transmit MIDI data using Arduino serial connections. It's a fascinating journey, but as with any adventure, there are hurdles to overcome.
Here's the challenge I'm currently facing: I'm looking to implement a seamless transition in my setup. Imagine this - with a simple click of a button (or ""bang,"" as we call it in the world of Pure Data), I want to send out another ""bang"" to a different message object or perhaps a number object, whichever is more suitable for the process at hand. This second ""bang"" will then work its magic to shift the currently playing note by 12 semitones, effectively transposing it.
Now, I won't pretend that my patching skills are perfect. In fact, I'm running into a curious issue where things seem to behave oddly. I suspect it might be related to how I'm connecting the notes to individual bangs, each linked to separate noteout channels. Yes, there's just one button involved (for now), and I confess, it's acting a bit like a diva on stage!
Here's a bit more context: I'm using Pure Data Extended, as I followed some video and tried it out, couldn't use in latest pd versions, particularly when dealing with larger patch configurations. However, I'm encountering problems when it comes to certain objects like 'iem_alisttosym,' 'zl group 100,' 'fromsymbol,' and others. The console log kindly informs me with a 'couldn't create' message, which has led me to believe that I might be missing something crucial.
This is where I turn to you, the creative minds of the forum. I'm keen to hear your thoughts, insights, and perhaps some innovative workarounds. How can I make this setup run as smoothly as a well-composed symphony? What are your preferred approaches to MIDI data manipulation, especially in situations like mine? And if you've ever danced with the laggy GUI dragon in Pure Data Extended, I'm all ears for your advice on keeping things both functional and visually pleasing.
So, dear forum members, what say you? Your guidance, suggestions, and expertise would not only help me solve this enigma but also inspire others who might be navigating similar terrain. Let's make music and tech collaborate harmoniously!
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. Your insights could very well be the melody my project needs to hit the right note.

a thing c and [expr],[expr~] share in common youcanwritefunctionswithoutanywhitespace so there didn't have to be any messy patching dealing with that - as an example it's being used for bytebeat (with some caveats about floats and things that [expr] doesn't like like sending it 0 with [value] at audio rate.

https://patchstorage.com/bytebeat-and-dynamic-repatching-pd-as-a-livecode-environment/
""this is an experimental way to allow dynamic repatching in PD and do livecoding just using pure data.
livecoding requires – 1) an obscure language – pure data is a dataflow programming language 2) an obscure text editor – well I cant think of a more arcane one than a visual programming language so check that off for pure data too.
Known limitations – it’s a little crashy – the List message box doesn’t like backspaces.
32 bit floats lose precision and can make it a seem a little wonky – not all patches will sound the same because Pure Data uses 32 bit floats for effeciency. so objects with / % >> will effectively “chop” off and the patch will sound different than a real bytebeat (or whatever you use this for) after a while or seem like it can just plain quit. The numbers either got too small or too big to work with 32 bit floats.
Another thing about 32 bit floats, the biggest number PD can count to is 1.6772e+07
Pure data also squashes numbers you get 123456 digits. 1234560 turns into 1.23456e+06. In comments this gets changed after you close, reopen so try cut/paste.
Also I noticed sending 0 into [expr] in the variables makes it unhappy and crash so I avoided it making x and y 1 or bigger.

Background:
Ganymede was created to test a bet I made with myself:
that I could boil down drum sequencing to a single knob (i.e. instead of writing a pattern).
As far as I am concerned, I won the bet.
The trick is...
Instead of using a knob to turn, for example, up or down a metro, you use it to turn up or down the modulus of a counter, ie. counter[1..16]>[mod X]>[sel 0]>play the sample. If you do this then add an offset control, then where the beat occurs changes in Real-Time.
But you'll have to decide for yourself whether I won the bet. .
(note: I have posted a few demos using it in various stages of its' carnation recently in the Output section of the Forum and intend to share a few more, now that I have posted this.)
Remember, Ganymede is an instrument, i.e. Not an editor.
It is intended to be ""played"" or...allowed to play by itself.
(aside: specifically designed to be played with an 8-channel, usb, midi, mixer controller and mouse, for instance an Akai Midimix or Novation LaunchPad XL.)
So it does Not save patterns nor do you ""write"" patterns.
Instead, you can play it and save the audio~ output to a wave file (for use later as a loop, song, etc.)

knobs for the modulators (When, Accent, and Offset) [1..16]
toggles if you want that parameter to be randomized after X bars


and when opened, 5 optional effects

adsr, vcf, delayfb, distortion, and reverb
D-W=dry-wet
2 parameters per effect





ALL:
when ON. sets the values for all of the tracks to the same value; reverts to the original values when turned OFF


MIDI:
CC 7=MASTER VOLUME
The other controls exposed to midi are the first four knobs of the accordion/main-gui. In other words, the Sample, When, Accent, and Offset knobs of each track. And the MUTE and SOLO of each track.
Control is based on a midimap file (./midimaps/midimap-default.txt).
So if it is easier to just edit that file to your controller, then just make a backup of it and edit as you need. In other words, midi-learn and changing midimap files is not supported.
The default midimap is:
By track
CCs

SAMPLES:
Ganymede looks for samples in its ./samples directory by subdirectory.
It generates a tof/pmenu from the directories in ./samples.
Once a directory is selected, it then searches for ./**/.wav (wavs within 1-deep subdirectories) and then ./*.wav (wavs within that main ""kit"" directory).
I have uploaded my collection of samples (that I gathered from https://archive.org/details/old-school-sample-cds-collection-01, Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike 4.0 International Creative Commons License,  90's Old School Sample CDs Collection by CyberYoukai) to the following link on my Google Drive:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQmrLqhACOXXSmaEf0Iz-PiO7kTkYzO0/view?usp=sharing
It is a large 617 Mb .7z file, including two directories: by-instrument with 141 instruments and by-kit with 135 kits. The file names and directory structure have all been laid out according to Ganymede's needs, ex. no spaces, etc.
My suggestion to you is unpack the file into your Path so they are also available for all of your other patches.
MAKING KITS:
I found Kits are best made by adding directories in a ""custom-kits"" folder to your sampls directory and just adding files, but most especially shortcuts/symlinks to all the files or directories you want to include in the kit into that folder, ex. in a ""bongs&congs""  folder add shortcuts to those instument folders. Then, create a symnlink to ""bongs&congs"" in your ganymede/samples directory.
Note: if you want to experiment with kits on-the-fly (while the patch is on) just remember to click the REFRESH bang to get a new tof/pmenu of available kits from your latest ./samples directory.
If you want more freedom than a dynamic menu, you can use the OPEN_IND(depedent)_DIR bang to open any folder. But do bear in mind, Ganymede may not see all the wavs in that folder.

AFTERWARD/NOTES


the [hcs/folder_list] [tof/pmenu] can only hold (the first) 64 directories in the ./samples directory


the use of 1/16th notes (counter-interval) is completely arbitrary. However, that value (in the [pd global_metro] subpatch...at the noted hradio) is exposed and I will probably incorporate being able to change it in a future version)


rem: one of the beauties of this technique is: If you don't like the beat,rhythm, etc., you need only click ALL to get an entirely new beat or any of the other randomizers to re-randomize it OR let if do that by itself on AUTO until you like it, then just take it off AUTO.


One fun thing to do, is let it morph, with some set of toggles and bars selected, and just keep an ear out for the Really choice ones and record those or step in to ""play"" it, i.e. tweak the effects and parameters. It throws...rolls...a lot of them.


Another thing to play around with is the notion of Limited (bumpy) or Infinite(flat) sequences in conjunction with the number of bars. Since when and where the modulator triggers is contegent on when it resets.


Designed, as I said before, to be played, esp. once it gets rolling, it allows you to focus on the production (instead of  writing beats) by controlling the ALL and Individual effects and parameters.


Note: if you really like the beat Don't forget to turn off the randomizers. CLEAR for instance works well. However you can't get the back the toggle values after they're cleared. (possible feature in next version)


The default.txt preset loads on loadbang. So if you want to save your state, then just click PRESETS>SAVE.


[folder_list] throws error messages if it can't find things, ex. when you're not using subdirectories in your kit. No need to worry about it. It just does that.

29,understanding a simple feedback oscillator,understanding a simple feedback oscillator,"I was just experimenting with the “classic” feedback FM and stumbled on a related technique that seems quite interesting to me, especially because of its chaotic behavior. It’s actually very simple: The output of an oscillator is delayed and, scaled by some factor, fed back into that same oscillator as its frequency. So there is no external input, no carrier frequency (or a zero carrier frequency if you will), which means that it is a symmetric “through-zero” FM.
feedback-oscillator.pd
By guessing I figured out how the delay time determines the frequency of the oscillator, but I still don’t understand a few things: Why is there a factor of 4 involved so that the delay is one quarter of a cycle? And why is there still some error? I found two ways to fix it, first by oversampling and second by reducing the delay time by the duration of one half sample. To be honest I don’t have a clue why this works ... Any ideas?
What I find particularly interesting is the path from sinusoidal tones at modulation index 1 (which seems to be a critical value) to different modes of periodic oscillation and finally to chaos when the modulation index is increased: First odd harmonics are added, then even harmonics, then a period doubling or “bifurcation” occurs, and shortly after that we get into the chaotic region. This seems to be not too different from the logistic map or related chaotic maps. So I’m wondering if it’s possible to analyze the oscillator in terms of chaos theory to better understand and control its behavior.
Apart from being mathematically interesting, I think this could also be a usable noise generator with spectral control. Other effects can be achieved by adding an external input ... but for now, I’m more interested in understanding that simpler case.","[{""text"": ""feedback-oscillator.pd"", ""link"": ""/uploads/files/1682761979668-feedback-oscillator.pd""}]"

47,Broken Square Waves?,Broken Square Waves?,"Hi, I'm looking for someone with a deeper understanding of PD and audio synthesis to help me understand why my patch sounds the way it sounds. I don't know why the audio is generated this way. I don't know if it is because of some expected behavior of square waves and the math behind it, or if it is because of some quirk of PD and the way I'm generating the square wave. If you think you can help, please stay with me, I don't know who to go to or what to study to help me understand this.
I was attempting to make a square wave from scratch, I saw some tutorials and I know there are more ""proper"" ways of doing this, but the simplest I could think of was -1 and 1 alternating. The osc I built is a metronome with a route alternating between -1 and 1 at a given hertz. But the result doesn't sound like a single square wave, there are some harmonics, almost like having senoidal waves mixed with the square wave.
Experimenting, I noticed a cycle of the resonances going from 1hz to 1378.125hz where it completely stops, like zero hz, or one tick in several, several minutes. Other cycles multiples of this frequency exist, like this:
n=1378.125hz
Cycle0 = 1 to n* 2^0
Cycle1 = n*(2^0) to n*(2^1)
Cycle2 = n*(2^1) to n*(2^2)
Cycle3 = n*(2^2) to n*(2^2)
? Cyclen= n2^(n-1) to n(2^n) ?
C0 and C1 are very similar, with subtle differences, but inside of C2 it seems like 2 times C0 or C1 (I didn't check it, but it sounds like this). Inside C3 there are 3 times, and next, C4, 4 times, and so on, the same cycle but more times and faster in each power of two.
I have made a patch that makes it easy to clone the osc to generate each Cycle. For example, clone 10 times to get audio files from C0 through C9.
Where do the resonances come from? Why these cycles exist? Are they some kind of harmonic series? Why 1378.125hz? Is this expected from the math, or is it a quirk result of some PD object (like inputing very low numbers to the metronome)? Does someone understand why this is happening?

Just use a ""clone"" of your operator! In theory, this should work for an arbitrary wavetable.
Perhaps somebody could tell me if I'm missing something important, but aurally, the difference between the naive approach and this are night and day, an sound sufficiently DX7-y to me.
The other trick, if you're trying to design a matrix-style with abstractions, is to make sure that you keep the ""original"" operator output out of its input, and that the modulation index goes to your ""clone"". I've accomplished that with dollar variables, as above, (e.g. operator 1 mods operator 1, ""[r op-$1-mod-$1]"") and in my matrix abstraction:

Basic flow-control here, $1 is the modulator operator id and $2 is the carrier operator id. So if they're the same (feedback!) don't let the signal through.
Anyway, I hope this helps anybody. I'll get the full synth up when the interfaces are a bit more usable, I'm pleased with how simple it's turning out to be.",[]

With Ewolverine you can genetically breed sounds, beats, melodies etc. out of your vst's or hardware midi gear.
Imagine a synthesizer that span's a multidimensional space that contains parameter combinations resulting in sounds.
Ewolverine helps you, via listening back and interpolating between random sounds of your synth, to automatically adjust the synthesizer's paramters to result in a sound that fits your needs.
To do so, it uses a genetic algorithm to interbreed parameters according to the Mendelian Laws Of Inheritance.
You cannot change a given synthesizer - you can only evolve it's parameters. That's called Micro-Evolution. Darwin's thoughts regarding Macro-Evolution would equal a change of the whole synthezier, that you can't change genetically, because you cannot dock Ewolverine's genetic algorithm to the program code of the synth itself (which had to be programmed, by the way). Ewolverine doesn't prove Evolution, like some people already euphoricly wanted to conclude on the fair I firstly presented it. It the more proves that an intelligence is needed to program a genetic algorithm and a synthesizer to use it on.
This program can really startle your philosophically trained mind, I tell you!

much fun, anyway!

It’s possible to save sounds into the patch and also to export the preset banks for each pad as files.
It listens to MIDI on channel 10 (you can change parameters on the device and save them into the patch) and sends MIDI on channels 11-16.
It probably would be possible to add sysex dumps from the device into pure data but i couldn’t get my head around backwards engineering the sysex format.

68,Polyphonic Guitar Synth,Polyphonic Guitar Synth,"Hi
I have made an attempt at a polyphonic guitar synth, inspired by the poly_tutorial.mmb.pd from maelstorm and utilising fiddle~ for the guitar input. its not MIDI out compatible yet, but MIDI keybord in is supported for note-on only (timed note-off).
Muted guitar input seems to achieve the best results.
The synth is a simple phasor and is in an abstraction for easy modification
There are 12 voices modified only by attack & decay + high & low pass filters at the output.
Voice stealing can switched on or off
There is also a mono synth for single string input & note bending, but its poly or mono, not both.
Requires Pd-extended
Some feedback would be great.

In my patch, I'm combining ""sinesum"" and ""cosinesum"" messages to calculate and then add the sine and cosine components of a waveform, using the Fourier transform idea. Furthermore, I'm not only calculating one single waveform but also a second one in quadrature to be able to do frequency shifting (this could, of course, also be done by simply using the Hilbert transform).
You can either draw the amplitudes and phases or calculate them. The chosen parameters for this may not be reasonable at all, but I really don't know how you would do this properly ...

73,Wind and Rain....,Wind and Rain....,"after years of ""pd-abstinence"" and not doing anything dsp-related at all,  i built a new patch in the past few days, which is roughly inspired by ""space drones"" from NI Reaktor. the patch can be used to create wind- and rain-like soundscapes or something like this... 
my main intention was to get into pd again and learn a bit about data structures to visualize sound particles and figure out, how the [clone] object works, which - afaik - was'n available last time i patched with pd.
i built a similar patch years ago, but i remember that voice management was a real pain in the ass, so i had to use dynamic patching for this, etc.
now, there's still a lot to do:

adjust parameters and their relations
gain compensation for high filter q
enhance visualisation of sound particles
and a lot more....

you will need to get some external libraries in order to get the patch working, i guess mainly zexy, cyclone and else.... there's an additional compressor external (t_comp~) in the abs-folder which is the stereo compressor from the FAUST libraries. since i'm on linux i compiled the external for osx and win32 via the FAUST online editor and couldn't test them afterwards - i hope they work for you... EDIT: here's the DSP file, for those who want to compile it with Faust Works or whatever....  t_comp.dsp
however, suggestions on how to enhance the patch are welcome!  thanks in advance for trying!

76,Preset system using savestate and an array!,Preset system using savestate and an array!,"Hey 
Just wanted to share an idea I got a while ago for making a preset system using ""savestate"" and an array.
I wanted to take advantage of ""savestate"" being able to actually store data to each unique version of an abstraction, without using .txt files. Everything is stored internally in PD.
It uses an array to temporarily hold the parameter data  and then use ""array get"" and ""array set"" to get and set the data to ""savestate"", for actual storing and recalling the data when saving and loading a pd patch,
I haven't seen anyone doing something similar, so I thought I'd share it.
It's very simple and it works really well. There is also a copy preset function build in.
It can be found on my Github page:
https://github.com/jaffasplaffa/Pure-data-patches/tree/master/Savestate-Preset-System
There is an description inside the abstraction that shows how to set it up. I think the description should work, if not, then let me know and I will add better description.
Have fun!

Basically it uses upsampling to use every ""location"" in a block as a separate oscillator. (so sample 2 in a block is oscillator 2, etc.) The subpatch is upsampled x64 with 64 block size so every sample 1 sample of 64 oscillators are being processed. [tabsend~] and [tabreceive~] are used for storing the phase of the sine waves in-between samples. It's probably relatively heavy on the processing. still I thought it was kinda cool.
If anyone knows how to get the sum of all samples in a block in vanilla that would also be helpful (I'm using [rfft~] now but don't need to do an entire fft just for the sum)

I would like to create a metronome that provides a beat time with phase, like the one provided by abl_link~ object, but in realm of messages.

Comparing my implementation to another one that uses [line ~], I noticed that the one with [line ~] is more precise, probably because [line~] provides more decimals than [line], and perhaps this is what causes the subdivisions based on [line] to be less precise.

CL: clear, set all beats to ""0"", i.e. off
U: undo random; return to the previously opened or saved preset, ie. not the previous random one
M: mute all tracks; the playheads continue moving but audio does not come out of any track
||:pause all playheads; play will resume from that location when un-paused
per: period; if 0=randomizes the period, >0  sets the period to be used for all beats
Edit Mode

Check the [E] to enter edit mode (to cut, copy, or paste selected regions of the pattern)

Entering edit mode will pause the playing of the pattern
Play, if doing so beforehand, will resume on leavng edit mode
The top-left most beat of the pattern grid will be selected when first entering edit mode


Single-click a beat to select the top-left corner of the region you wish to cut or copy
Double-click a beat to select the bottom-right corner

You may not double-click a beat ""less than"" the single-clicked (top-left) beat and vice-versa


Click [CL] to clear your selection (i.e. start over)
The selected region will turn to dark colors
If only one beat is selected it will be the only one darkened
Click the operation (bang) you wish to perform, either cut [CU] or copy [CP]

Then, hold down the CTRL key and click the top-left corner of where you want to paste the region
The clicked cell will turn white
And click [P] to paste the region


Cut and copied regions may both be pasted multiple times

The difference being, cutting sets the values (gains) for the originating region to ""0""


Click [UN] to undo either the cut, copy, or paste operation

Undoing cut will return the gains from 0s to their original value

jass-v1.0.1( esp with midi fixes).zip
1.0.1-CHANGES:

Fixed issues with midi routing, re the mode selector (mentioned below)
Upgraded the midi mode ""fetch"" abstraction to be less granular
Fix (for midi) so changing cc[""14"",""15"",""16""] to ""rnd"" outputs a random wave (It has always done this for non-midi.)
Added a midi-mode-tester.pd (connect PD's midi out to PD's midi in to use it)
Upgrade: cc-56 and cc-58 can now change pbend-cc and mod-cc in all modes
Update: the (this) readme

INFO: Values setting to 0 on initial cc changes is (given midi) to be expected.

JASS is a clone-based, three wavetable, 16 voice polyphonic, Dual-channel synth.
With...

The initial, two wavetables combined in 1 of 5 possible ways per channel and then adding those two channels. Example: additive+frequency modulation, phase+pulse-modulation, pulse-modulation+amplitude modulation, fm+fm, etc
The third wavetable is a ring modulator, embedded inside each mod type
8 wave types, including a random with a settable number of partials and a square with a settable dutycycle
A vcf~ filter embedded inside each modulation type
The attack-decay-release, cutoff, and resonance ranges settable so they immediately and globally recalculate all relevant values
Four parameters /mod type: p1,p2, cutoff, and resonance
State-saving, at both the global level (wavetables, env, etc.), as well as, multiple ""substates"" of for-each-mod-type settings.
Distortion, reverb
Midiin, paying special attention to the use of 8-knob, usb, midi controllers (see below for details)
zexy-limiters, for each channel, after the distortion, and just before dac~

cc - Modes M, E, R, O
Jass is designed so that single knobs may be used for multiple purposes without reentering the previous value when you turn the knob, esp. as it pertains to, 8-knob controllers.
Thus, for instance, when in Mode M(pgm=124) your cc send the signals as listed below. When you switch modes, that knob will then change the values for That mode.
In order to do this, you must turn the knob until it hits the previously stored value for that mode-knob.
After hitting that previous value, it will begin to change the current value.
cc - Modes M, E, R, O assignments
Where [10..17] may be the midi cc #'s you enter in the MIDI symbol field (as mentioned above) aligned to your particular midi controller.

In closing
If you have anywhere close to as much fun (using, experimenting with, trying out, etc.) this patch, as I had making it, I will consider it a success.
For while an arduous learning curve (the first synth I ever built), it has been an Enormous pleasure to listen to as I worked on it. Getting better and better sounding at each pass.
Rather, than say to much, I will say this:
Enjoy. May it bring a smile to your face.
Peace through love of creating and sharing.

105,soundscape layering - looking for input!,soundscape layering - looking for input!,"Hello all!
Attaching a work in progress, would love some feedback. Especially on the interface - I feel like there's a lot going on, with the delay lines, with the playback speed ratio... So if there's anything that doesn't feel intuitive, anything that could be simpler, anything that doesn't need to be there, let me know! Looking for ""user feedback"" !
The gist is this: you open two samples, and they loop in the background - it's ""played"" by periodically allowing the signal through, into delay lines. there's a fader to move between the two channels, and playback speed is determined by ratios, so that the layers are musically/harmonically related.
One way to use it: set up a bed of low-frequency sounds, and then double the speed (2 to 1 ratio), add some moments of a-perfect-fifth-above (3 to 2) and create melodies.
Here is an example, using clips from two piano pieces recorded to tape.

It's 3 techno drums that are quite efficient. The kick and snare contain no oscillators but use a wrapped line segment. Total DSP count - 4 multiplies and a cos. This trick is extended in the snare with a feedback around a second function which results in a chaotic band of noise around the center frequency. Becuase we use [vline~] and always start on the same phase they sound pretty tight.

110,Matrix sequencer - using both Akai APC mini and Akai Midimix,Matrix sequencer - using both Akai APC mini and Akai Midimix,"mtrxsequencerbeta1.pd
Hi ! This is pretty beta for know but is working. There are some mistakes like use of subpatches when abstractions would have been better. I’ve been building this kind of matrix sequencer for Akai’s APCmini and Midimix. This requires no externals.
There are two sequences, a green one which goes up to down, from left column to right column
and the red one which goes left to right, from upper line to down line.
The outputs are for each note : the value of the corresponding faders (vertical and horizontal) of each grid’s button.
You can select the 64 buttons of the apc grid, which will output a value only if they’re selected (coloured in yellow), like a trigger. However there  is also a trigger unsensitive output.
The midimix 8 first faders are for (from left to right) upper to down lines
the apc 8 first faders are for left to right columns
the 9th fader of midimix is for the lenght of the green sequence, the 9th fader of apcmini is for the length of the red sequence
there are also on the APC 8 buttons for each column and 8 buttons for each lines, there’s a little bug to fix there, as you have to tickle them a bit at the beginning to make them work properly (just press  some of the buttons until they light on correctly)
the two sequences are a modulo of the sum of bangs received by the main metro. Modulo of the lenght of each sequence. This sum is multiplied by 1 to 8 thanks to the buttons. And divised by 1 to 8 thanks to these buttons when you also press the last square button which is between those round buttons. So if you multiply by one and divise by two, the sequence will be twice slower. If you multiply by two and divise by one, the sequence will be as fast buy will go from step n to step n+2, n+4 …
The interest here is to create polyrythmical sequences. I,e : red sequence * 5, green sequence *6, both sequences lenght = 60. and things like that. And it’s pretty graphic
okay.
Really sorry for my bad english. Hope this could help/inspire someone. And i would really like returns, as I’m a bit beginning in pd.
I will  soon share a new version with abstractions in place of subpatches, in order not to modifiy each subpatches if you want to modifiy something (some places of the patch are 64 repetitions of the same thing, which could be a bit boring to do). mtrxsequencerbeta1.pd","[{""text"": ""mtrxsequencerbeta1.pd"", ""link"": ""/uploads/files/1608369732064-mtrxsequencerbeta1.pd""}, {""text"": ""mtrxsequencerbeta1.pd"", ""link"": ""/uploads/files/1608369732064-mtrxsequencerbeta1.pd""}]"

I doubt the oversampling is done in a ""textbook"" way, but it sounds OK. I'd enjoy any discussion or input about oversampling -- or anything else in the patch...
The parent Dir has the Pd patch, plus Camomile LV2 and VST plugins (for linux currently). But it should be trivial to make iOS or Windows versions of the plugins. I didn't do that, 'cause I can't test the plugins. The Camomile ""Example"" files are included.

124,polyphonic step sequencer,polyphonic step sequencer,"Hi there,
I've made a polyphonic step sequencer in pd with an akai fire controler as hardware interface. Here's a demonstration video on how it works:

I'm pretty happy with the result so far, though there's always room for improvement. Let me know what you think and you can download the patch here to have a go with it yourself:

depends on: zexy moonlib list-abs iemlib
VSLIDER verion (No moonlib dependency)
s3s(sliders).zip
depends on: zexy list-abs iemlib
This is an example, demonstration patch, though fully functional in its own right, demonstrating the use of the fx1000 multi-effects pedal abstraction (included in the zip where more details about it are available in its -help file).
Like its predecessor, the fx600, the fx1000 is a cheap, fast, and easy to use multieffects abstraction (though including 10 not 6 effects) that, when combined, can easily create wonderful, highly complex, and original sounds. Each fx1000 includes: chorus, delay, distortion, flanger, phaser, pitchshifter, reverb, tremelo, vcf, and vibrato.
The s3s includes:

a sample or adc~ toggle, which sets whether to receive audio~ from a sample (.wav) file or adc~;
a sample player, with both a short, default (Pachabel's Canon) sample for testing and an openpanel to either test or even edit and remaster tracks;
presets (for all three pedals) via savepanel and openpanel. There is no need to navigate anywhere to save the preset, just click ""SAVE"", enter a filename, and click ""Save"" (they are all stored in the fx1000/presets folder with a prefix in the format ""pedal1effect-pedal2effect-pedal3effect""+whatever you entered). Note: you Do need to navigate to that folder to load a preset;
a parallel or serial selector which either sums, i.e. +~ all three effects, or serializes them, audio~>1>2>3>masterout~;
and
a transport control (abs) for recording your work, which includes fadein and fadeout bangs and times(ms) which starts recording from env~=0 and then sends a line~ ramp up to 0.9 or vice versa sends line~ down then stops recording when env~=0. Recordings are saved at fx1000/recordings.

If you just turn dsp one and click the ""PLAY"" toggle, it will play the default(loadbang) voice (3 choruses).

p.s. one really fun thing to do is set it to ""Parallel"", then ""R""andomly set the 3 pedals, and switch to Series, and tweak the knobs. Parallel allows you to hear each one, while Series allows you to hear the...whacked out...result. If it's cool, just save it with a name.

what you think, is it working? Both objects on the help file take about 40% of my CPU power, but I'm on a wild machine
I made some changes on the original work by Tom Erbe. It is supposed to be more efficient because the FFT on the input is only done once! I tried the idea of having each partition work with FFT saved on tables, so we wouldn't need to perform FFTs in different instances of clone, but that doesn't seem to be possible. And, well, it is made as an abstraction and all you need to do is give it the window size and the IR sound file name...  it calculates the number of instances on that and I needed to rely on some dinamic patching magic

143,Minx,Minx,"Xmas 2012 was pretty good.
I still had never heard of Pure Data or OSC.
I was still productive, just getting my computer booted for emails, sound and video editing etc.
And then it happened.
I was asked for a complete wireless stage monitoring system with control by the musicians, and the manufacturers for the professional market had nothing to offer at that time.
Data flow programming was made for me. I love it, and I cannot leave it alone.
I might not be very good at it, but I no longer do anything else.
Anyway, here is the current state of the project, for anyone who might find it useful.
It took longer to get around to writing the manual than it did to write the patches.
It is a fairly extreme example of the power of dynamic patching.
The patch is always dynamically built to the specification required.
There is some dynamic patching while it is running..... to change input and output routing.
The pronounced demise of extended forced an attempt at compliance with vanilla.
Every problem was resolved except the cookbook calcs for [biquad~] and I gave up and forgot about the conversion to Vanilla..
I had even built a dynamically created abstraction to replace [matrix~] from the cyclone library.
But now the ggee library is available through Deken for 64-bit Pd...
The Vanilla version has not been so extensively tested as the Extended version.
Minx could be used by a band for headphone monitoring in rehearsal too.
If you add a multitrack recorder/player it could be used for solo practice and a virtual soundcheck as well.
Anyway, here it is in its current state.
Extended...... Minx Extended.zip
Vanilla (requires ggee library)..... Minx Vanilla.zip
The Manual (written for the Extended version but valid for Vanilla)..... Minx Manual and Readme.zip

Batch files are a good way to start Pd as all the parameters can be set for the project.
They are not absolutely necessary, but your patch can be opened with different settings for different situations.
I have put a demo SCENE file (for 10 inputs / six outputs) and a demo TRACKS file so you can see it working straight away.
I have included only one short track so as to reduce download bloat...... the Manual is already more than twice as big as the patch....!
If you don't want to use TouchOSC then I am sure the remote controls can be built with Mobmuplat.
If you don't have a soundcard with 10 inputs and 6 outputs you will see some ""connection failed"" messages in the terminal...... but they are unimportant....... the patch will just be working for the inputs and outputs that you have.

155,Aftertouch last note priority,Aftertouch last note priority,"Hi, I am trying to implement this feature for a hardware synth. I decided to write notes and velocity into separate arrays - here could someone explain why I need to shift the note array -1 to have both of them in sync. This part of the patch works great.
Now imagine this scenario. On a 6 voice synth I hold for example 3 notes chord in the bottom and play monophonic lines on top, with the aftertouch effecting only the last top note. But as soon as I play two notes on top, than if I release last one of the top notes I want the previous one to take priority.
Here is the algorithm I am trying to achieve: if there is a noteoff message, go back in the array and compare stored notes to the noteoff number. If you find another noteoff message, store its number and go further back. This way it should be possible to to find the last note that you still hold and assign aftertouch to it. To ensure there wouldn’t be endless loop in case you release all note I added a counter object and it lets the algorithm run only 6 times (size of the arrays). Each new noteoff message resets the counter.
Right now the note numbers after a noteoff event either don’t come out at all or the result is wrong.
Can you see why the patch is faulty or maybe suggest a cleaner way to do this?

158,How to detect a hit on the guitar strings (coming through [adc~]) and use it as a simple bang trigger,How to detect a hit on the guitar strings (coming through [adc~]) and use it as a simple bang trigger,"Greetings.
I frequently use a live guitar in my PD patches, I route it through the mic input [adc~]. But now I am facing a problem, that you might help me with.
I am interested in detecting in PD the moment of hitting the guitar strings with the hand, e.g. like using a hand to drum on the strings.
It is a very percussing sound, similar to a snare hit.
I would like to detect this hit on the guitar strings in PD (coming through [adc~]) and use it as a simple bang trigger.
It would be easy to use the [fiddle~] attack output, but I don't want the trigger on any other guitar playing event (e.g., chords, notes ...) except on this percussive hit on the strings.
Do you have any guidance on where to start to tackle this problem?
I don't have the slightest idea where to search for information regarding this topic.",[]

OverBlast is a sampler sequencer that will be used as the UI for a DIY midi workstation with a Raspberry pi. And now with a lot of help from people in this forum I have been able to play midi sequences from midi hardware which was a huge step in its development process. Boy let me tell you learning puredata has been an experience that taught me to learn from the headaches and appreciate the highs. lol

In its current state I have been  At this point there are a few known bugs. listed below.
Known Bugs

Sample Editor - Truncate btn dose not work correctly. saves whatever is in soundfiler buffer should clip start and end positions.
Sample Editor - Loop playback toggle dose not do anything at the moment. sample will automaticly loop.
Sample Editor - When start and end positions are adjusted the patch will crash the next time the sample is played or looped
Sample Editor - Loop playback toggle dose not do anything at the moment. sample will automaticly loop.
Sample Editor - Time stretch dose not to any thing. pitch slider will only changes the pitch. Time stretch should take in account the pitch and bmp to make it a true time strecth.
Sample Editor - Loop playback toggle dose not do anything at the moment. sample will automaticly loop.
Sample Editor - Export as Wave dose not do anything at the moment.
Sequencer dose not work.. WIP contains only ui design
Song builder does not work. WIP contains only ui design

With that said if you wish to play around with this patch it will more then likely crash while using the sample editor if the start and end positions are adjusted as there is still work to be done with it. The only thing that works in the sample editor is the sample recorder. You are able to record sample and import them to the sample editor to be edited but you cant actually make edits yet.
So why release the patch in this state? Well i could use some feedback and peoples thoughts on the workflow. And simply if there is anyone out there that is interesting in lending a hand in its development. What can you do with it?
You can load samples to the mixer and play sequences from your midi hardware. Record samples from a mic to the sample editor and play them (Dont adjust the start and end positions) it may crash.
Again the song builder and sequencer do not work they are simply ui designs. Be warned if you are going to dive int he sample editor is very messy as it was when I was doing the majority of my exploration/noobing into puredata. I have been slowly cleaning it up. 
I should mention you can learn midi notes then save them as a preset the pad controller is fully functional.
Sadly I cant make a video my laptop locks up when I try to use obs or xsplit.

OverBalst is a 32 step sampler sequencer written in Vanilla 0.49.0 it features a sample editor to chop wave samples to then be used with the sequencer its pretty straight forward.

In this current build you can not export a song to wave but they can be played in full length. Again I should mention this is buggy.

I implemented the Xiaolin Wu circle algorithm to get somewhat nice circles out of data structures. Only somewhat, because the color resolution of data structures is very limited, it has only eight values for every RGB color. So when the foreground and the background are very far away color-wise, like black and white, the algorithm gets a somewhat good result. Not perfect as in the original algorithm, as the color values still have to be rounded to the nearest data structure color. But it is alright. If background and foreground are very close, there is not very much room for interpolation and the result gets worse. Anyhow, this is the patch: circle20.pd

I am not sure if this is already finished, as the patch is almost two years old. I remember having a hard time calculating the number of actual dots to draw the circle.

Here's a polyphonic granular playback (and sampling) patch, I've been working on it for a while, I've used some different versions of it for a few different projects like the EN-1 video I posted last week. Full patches here: https://github.com/yannseznec/Granular-Polyphonic
It's currently 8 voice polyphonic, and uses 8 grains. These could both be raised significantly on any standard computer, I've kept them low for running on low-spec boards. It currently uses MIDI note input to play, with the note values controlling pitch. All other settings are controlled via UI sliders.
It's getting to a pretty decent point now, where it's relatively flexible...my long-term goal has been to make it somewhat drag-and-droppable.
It still needs work, of course! A few things I'd like to get some feedback on, if anyone has the energy to download all of the patches and have a play:

At certain pitch values (particularly low ones) there is a fair amount of high frequency noise. I guess this is aliasing? I've tried to use the lop~ object to filter this out but it hasn't proven to be a satisfying solution. Any tips? I can just about understand why it's happening, with all of the fast phasors going on and the repitching of a sound file and so on, but it's still somewhat frustrating.

Videos (patch attaced to next post) - this one makes sound from the average HSV values per video frame. Also uses blob detection to sonify the spatial location of objects.
They both output MIDI too so you can send them out of Pd for sound (which is especially good for the video one because it struggles with sound and video rendering at the same time)

Artificially increases the depth and width of a stereo track (will not work on mono tracks).
It sounds pretty nice! 
How this works: Essentially we are taking a stereo track, converting it to a mono stream, inverting it, and rendering it mixed with the stereo track again. I figured this out from a friendly user over at the audacity forums here: http://goo.gl/EfLTIf
Just click the bang, open a wav file and hit start!

""GLSL is the absolutely worst medium for rendering this,

might have ideas about this.
On the left is a return diagram. It is an X-Y plot of a
function against itself at a constant offset. The offset is
a tunable parameter. If it is set to one fourth of the
period of a certain frequency, then waves at that frequency
will cause the diagram to draw circles. Other frequencies
will cause some kind of ellipses.
On the right is a phase space diagram of the signal. It is
an X-Y plot of the signal against its differential. The
scaling factor applied to the differential is a sort of
tunable paramater too, which again allows you to choose one
frequency to form perfect circles.
These both draw kind of neat patterns, but not really neat
enough to work as visualization. How could this be improved?
(You'd probably have to do it in something other than a single
shader, though, to be able to draw more points, or lines.
Having access to more of the signal might also be a good thing.)""

Requirements:
wget, Linux command line web retrieval  tool
Linux
ggee, [shell]
cyclone, [counter]
Use Case:
Actors: those who want to hear the patterns in DNA nucleotide sequences and/or comprehend how Nature makes Music not ""noise""/Gene sequences are like one of Nature's ""voices""/
Case:
Enter the ""Accession"" (identification number (id)) of a NCBI DB entry into the id symbol field
Case:
Click on ""LOAD""
Case:
Click ""PLAY"".
Instructions:
1-Go to the DB (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/) and find an Accession(id) of a sequence;
2-Enter that value into the ID [symbol] box of the patch
3-Click the ""LOAD"" [button/bang];
4-Set pitch, velocity, duration, and repeat for G,A,C, and T (representing the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand — guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine);
5-Toggle ""PLAY"" to 1, i.e. to On, to hear the sequence using the variables you set in 4) and to ""0"" to stop it.
How It Works:
The patch takes the input ID and packs it into a string as the FILE(Path) for wget.
The wget command is then sent as a list to a shell object.
The output of the shell object is then parsed (using an intermediate [text] object) into a [text] object with each line being 4 characters long, each character being either G,C,A, or T.
Once loaded and Play is clicked, each line is then reconstructed as a midi note with the pitch as determined by the first character, velocity (2nd) and duration (3rd) and repeated as many times as the 4th character dictates (as set in 4) above).
Once the entire sequence is played, the player stops sending notes.
Inlets(left to right):
id, either numbers or symbols
values, a 16 item list of 4x4 sets of pitch, velocity, duration, repeat (i.e. one set per nucleotide type, G,C,A, or T) (Note: the sequence, if loaded, will play immediately upon receipt of this list.)
beats per minute,  bpm, esp. as it relates to note durations.
Outlets:
the current midi note, i.e. pitch/velocity/duration
id (of the gene sequence)
sequence name, as listed by the NCBI DB
nucleotide being played as a string, ex. GGAC
AFTERWARD:


Since it really is only sending midi value it can be connected to whatever synth you would like;


Elsewhere on this Forum, I shared a patch which took ""noise"" as its input and converted it into music using sigmund~, in that case ""running water"" as its source. (See for reference: https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/topic/12108/converting-noise-to-music-rushing-water-using-sigmund) This patch takes that concept and applies it to what might also be called ""noise"", DNA sequences, were it not that the results (like the running water, yet even more so) sound like ""Music"".


This exploration has me wondering...
How can we delineate what is noise (only natural at this point) and what is music?
Is the creative/ordering/soulful nature's being expressed in our own music not also being expressed by Nature itself? ...so that we might be considered one ""bow"" playing upon it?
And, if by Music we mean notes laid down on purpose, might not it be said that is what Nature has been done? Is doing?
I hope you find the patch useful, stimulating, and exciting, or at the very least funny to think about.
Love through Music, no matter in what state Life may find you,
Peace,

191,MusicPlayer extension for the Ofelia effect VideoPlayer ;),MusicPlayer extension for the Ofelia effect VideoPlayer ;),"Now that it is possible to generate shader visuals with sound information in Pure Data (it was before with Gem, right?),
I was wondering how it can work the other way around. To generate sound or at least sound information with shaders and send it to Pure Data. There are some very interesting examples of how to use the GPU for sound generation. This one is Shadertoy again:

This seems also interesting: https://www.fsynth.com/
Anyway, I read out one horizontal pixel line per frame and use the rgb information for generating MIDI notes.
I also use the mScale abstraction from @ingox for scaling the notes.
The player generates also MIDI notes from images, it is only silent if the whole scanned line is very dark or very bright .
My first approach was to generate audio from the pixel information like in the examples above, but the sound was always distorted (but I am sure it could work... ).

I am working on a Sound Installation for a special Education School. The Installation is going to be located in the Snoezel Room (a room with a soothing and stimulating environment). So the basic Idea is, that you can press a button (or another input device like IR ... still working on this) and then a ""Star"" (Led lights at the ceiling) turns on and a corresponding sound is heard. The light is supposed to fade together with the sound. To be able to achieve this I want tu use a Bela that runs a PD Patch and controls the LEDs. So right now I am still working on the basic Patch, that has to be PD Vanilla (because of Bela). Right now I am working with 8 ""Stars"" and when you press a button (right now on a midi Controller) it starts an ADSR Envelope that controls a Bandpass Filtered noise sound. You can chose different scales like Overtones, Pentatonic, .... . Additionaly I have added atmospheric sounds like water and waves/wind to create a soothing atmosphere. What I want to do now (and where I do not know how to achieve this) is:


I would like to integrate a Loop Function, that saves all the Input Data (Numbers and the Time when they are triggered). It should start to record the Data when the first Sound is triggered and then when there was no Input for a certain threshold (like 5 - 10 sec) it should play back the recorded Data in a Loop.


For the Atmosphere I also would like to add a soothing tonal drone that fits the Sound of the Scale of the Resonating Noise. I tried something with a phasor~ an long attack and release and a bit of filtering ... but it really does not sound good and soothing now. Any suggestions on how to get an atmospheric soothing slowly changing drone like tonal sound would be of big help!",[]

205,abl_link~ midi and audio sync setup,abl_link~ midi and audio sync setup,"Hi Folks,
I thought I’d share this patch in the hopes that someone might be able to help improve upon it. I am by no means even semi competent with PD and jumped into this task without actually bothering to learn the basics of PD or RPi, but nevertheless here we are: maybe you can share a better implementation.
Mods/experienced folks, if I am sharing irrelevant/wrong/confusing info, mea culpa and please correct me.
I wanted to make a patch for PD in Raspberry Pi that would do 3 things:

Get the abl_link~ temp data over wifi
Create a midi clock output using a 5-pin midi adapter (I have one of the cheapo usb-to-midi cable things here)
-simultaneously create an audio pulse ‘clock’ output such as those used by volcas, Teenage Engineering Pocket operators, and the like (I am not sure if such an audio signal over a 3.5mm jack would be hot enough to be considered a CV pulse too, maybe you can help clear that up?)

As I say, after much struggles I have globbed something together that sort of does this.
A couple of things for newcomers like myself:
The abl_link~ object in the patch isn’t initially part of the standard pure data install as I write. I was able to use deken (ie the code that powers the ‘help/find externals’ bit of PD) to look for abl_link~. Search for it. At the time of writing there is a version for Arm7 devices like the Raspberry Pi 3 which was put together by the illustrious mzero with code from antlr. Go ahead and install the abl_link~ object. (Possibly you may have to uncheck the ‘hide foreign architectures’ box to get the arm7 version to show up. This is usually a safeguard to stop users from trying to install versions of externals that won’t work on their systems. So long as you see ‘arm7’ in the description it should hopefully be the one you want) PD will ask where you want to store the external, and I would just leave it at the default unless you have a special reason to do otherwise.
To get the patch to hook up to your preferred audio and midi outputs by default you may have to take certain steps. In my version of it I have deemed the built in audio and my cheapo USB midi output to be good enough for this task.
[As part of my troubleshooting process I ended up installing amidiauto which is linked to here: https://community.blokas.io/t/script-for-launching-pd-patch-with-midi-without-aconnect/1010/2
I undertook several installations in support of amidiauto which may be helping my system to see and link up my USB midi and PD, but nothing worked until I took the step in the following paragraph about startup flags in PD. (It may also be that I did not need to put in amidiauto at all. Maybe I’ll try that on another card to see if it simplifies the process. I’m saying you might want to try it without amidiauto first to see).]
Midi: - (ALSA is the onboard audio and midi solution that is part of Raspbian). To have PD use ALSA midi at the start I made the following setting in the preferences/startup dialog - within that window there is a section (initially blank) for startup flags. Here you can set instructions for PD to take note of when it starts up. I put in -alsamidi to tell it that alsamidi will be my preferred midi output. (I also took the step of going to file/preferences/midi settings, then ‘apply’ and ‘ok’ to confirm the Alsa midi ports that showed up. Then I went back to file/preferences/save all preferences. This seems to have (fingers crossed) saved the connection to my USB midi output.
Audio: I used the terminal and sudo raspi-config to set my audio out to the internal sound card (advanced options/audio/3.5mm jack). Since I had a fairly unused installation of PD I’d never asked it to do anything but work with the system defaults so getting audio out was fairly simple.
[nb I initially stuck this patch together on my Mac where everything worked pretty trouble free in terms of audio and midi selection]
About the patch. Obviously it is sort of horrible but there it is. It is a combination of stuff I cribbed from the demo example of abl_link~ in the example, and two example patches created by users NoDSP and jpg in this forum post https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/topic/9545/generate-midi-clock-messages-from-pd/2
As well as some basic synthesis to make the bip bip noises I learned from LWMs youtube channel
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5MbnaoDDuRPFsqaQpU9ig
Any and all errors and bad practice are mine alone.
The patch has some comments in it that doubtless expose my own lack of understanding more than anything. Undoubtedly many users can do a better job than I can.
Some observations on limitations/screwups of the patch:


If you disconnect from the stream for a bit, it will attempt to catch up. There will be a massive flurry of notes and/or audio bips as it plays all the intervening notes.


It doesn’t seem to be too fussy about where in the bar it is getting started (It will be ""on"" the beat but sometimes the ‘1’will be the ‘2’ etc. This is okay if I’m using internal sequencers from scratch (in the volca, say) but not if there is an existing pattern that I am trying to have come in 'on the 1'.


My solution to more detailed subdivision of bars was to make a big old list of numbers up to 32 so that abl_link~ can count up to more than 4. There’s probably a better solution for this. If you find that you need even more subdivisions because you are making some sort of inhumanly manic speed gabba, add even yet more numbers and connections.


I haven’t tested this much. And since it’s taken me the better part of 18 months to do this at all, I’m really not your guy to make it work any better. I’m posting here so that wiser souls can do a better job and maybe share what I think has the potential to be a useful midi sync tool.
I plan to revisit https://community.blokas.io/t/script-for-launching-pd-patch-with-midi-without-aconnect/1010/3
for some pointers on setting this up to launch the patch at startup to give me a small, portable midi Link sync device for 5-pin and audio-pulse clocked devices.

Any questions welcome
Have fun
Dave Adams (Balwyn)
a-drum-kit comprises a clock with 16 start and stop points, four 64 column velocity patterns and four programmable drum modules.
The clock controls from the top left are bang for reset, indicator for an external OSC clock pulse on port 9000, on/off button, repeat on/off button (default on), bang for save clock settings, bang for load clock settings *.clk tempo knob, start point knob, current point knob (read only), end point knob, repeat start and end sliders with return to start led.
The four pattern modules have 64 x 16 level velocity settings driven in sync from the clock, each module outputs to the adjacent drum module.
The four drum modules are identical. They have ADSR, level, pan, vcf & Q settings for both osc and noise, plus frequency tuning for the osc. There is an effect and duration for both, which ramps the freq of osc and the vcf of the noise up or down from the original point over time.
THE YELLOW SAVE BOX -- THIS IS TACKY BUT IT WORKS:- IF YOU PLACE THE CURSOR AT THE END THE TEXT AND PRESS ENTER. A DIRECTORY OF THAT NAME WILL BE CREATED IN YOU HOME DIRECTORY
The yellow box on the right of the save label is a text entry with a default text of ~/PureData/Drums/. There is a space at the end of the default text that needs to be backspaced over before adding the new name. Using this box creates a new subdirectory when the enter-key is pressed and then opens a save as dialog box within the new subdirectory. Just enter the name of subdirectory again in the filename field and the folowing files will be saved there filename.clk, filename.drm, filename.drm-2, filename.drm-3, filename.drm-4 and filename.set
The Gui-bang next to the load label opens the open file dialog for loading all the parts and defaults to ~/PureData/Drums/. Open a directory and select any file, as only filename part before the extension is used for loading
There are separate [S] and [L] bangs for saving and loading the clock, each drum pattern and the whole drumset settings
Along with the clock settings the volume, low pass filter and high pass filter are saved and loaded
For this to work out of the box you will need to create a Directory ~/Puredata/Drums/. the tilde (~)refers to your home folder in linux and your user folder in windows and the copy files in the attached /Drums directory to your newly created /Drums directory

Granular syntesis or ""playing"" a waveform on the other hand do not give access to properties of an instrument  in the way that I could change the material of an instrument.

210,Messages and numbers to ascii numbers and viceversa with Pyext.,Messages and numbers to ascii numbers and viceversa with Pyext.,"Hello everybody:
Here I'm sharing a python script that contains two classes to instance using the amazing pyext library. One of these two classes converts messages and numbers to a series of its ascii character codes along with an index number, so one can store a message right away in a table. The other class does the inverse job.
There is a patch that tries to show how this is implemented, á la help-patch.
This works by putting the script into the <whateverComesFirst>/pyext/py-master/scripts/ folder so the pyext external can 'see' it.  <edit> I am using Pd-vanilla 0.47-1 on Debian Stretch </edit>
Well, let me know if this is useful to anyone if you want.
Best regards.

Over the weekend I finished some patches for you.
In the fall, I revisited some techniques I was working on and stumbled onto a way to create a harmonic-rich and time&frequency variable oscillation. The system is bone-headed and sounds ugly in certain ranges. In other ranges, it sounds lovely. I decided it would be fun to draft up a quick analog style mono synth around it, then got carried away. I'm eager to move on to my next projects which will be considerably better suited to the spirit of pd.
From a DSP standpoint, there's some scary stuff going on under the hood, but I think they are fun to play.

The markov generator is part of two patches but can easily be used as an abstraction.
I want to use it for pattern variations of a sequencer for example.
It just needs a Pure Data list as input and outputs a markov chain of variable order and length.
Or draw into the array and submit it to the markov generator.
The first patch is an experiment trying to create interesting sounds with the markov algorithm.
In addition I used the variable Delay from the Pure Data help files:

223,Noise filter for microphone (Live Audio),Noise filter for microphone (Live Audio),"Well, the forum crash seems to have eaten my last post.
I have made a noise filter to clean up audio signals live.
Other noise removal filters need to have a noise sample  selected and try to remove that noise from the complete track - they only work offline.
This patch works online.  It removes any stationary noise from the signal and doesn't need any user adjustment except that it does need to be told how much to reduce the noise.
""Stationary noise"" is a signal whose frequency content and amplitude stay (more or less) constant for over 1 second.  Fan hum is a good example, as well as the more or less ""white"" noise from the wind from the fan.  Car motor sounds from a car travelling at constant speed is also a good example.
It will also kill feedback squeal cold, even at the lowest settings.
The patch is built in layers, and the lower layers can be used independently or combined and used to build different filters.
The attached zip file includes all the components from the lowest level up to a complete demonstation that takes in audio from a microphone and puts out filtered audio on line out.  It also includes a set of help files that describe the function and use of the various modules.
Included modules:
NoiseLevelDetector.pd - estimates the amplitude of the stationary noise
NoiseFilter.pd - attenuates the signal based on the amplitude from
NoiseLevelDetector.pd  Since it is more effective at high frequencies, it is best to feed it limited bandwidth signals and use multiple filters to cover the desired audio range.
BandLimitedNoiseFilter.pd - a Noisefilter that only works on the specified frequency range.
MultibandNoiseFilter.pd - a complete filter that covers the range from 40Hz upto 22000 hz to filter the complete audio spectrum.
Test.pd - demo program that demonstrates the use of MultibandNoiseFilter.pd
It works best for speaking voices.  Singing tends to be more stationary.  It could be adapted to singing voices by changing a single value in one of the lower level blocks.
The original idea was to create filter for removing car noises from microphone audio for two-way radios.  When used to cover just the range from 300Hz to 3000Hz, it does a very good job.
The biggest disadvantage is that it will start making ""musical noise"" if there is a lot of noise and the attenuation is set high.  It also adds a slight echoing quality to the filtered audio.
The project is hosted on GitHub: PureData NoiseFilter project.

I used the last few days to analyze the authentic expression technology filter in Native Instruments' ""Kontakt"" to make my own remake of it in form of a multiple input audio source morphing tool that functions exactly like the AET filter in NI Kontakt. I'll upload a video demo on how it's done, soon. For now here's the description. This following little patch is a recreation of how Kontakt's modwheel behaves in relation to key velocity. You need it for an authentic AET experience.
Henry velocity plus modwheel merger.pd
What Kontakt's channel vocoder does is this: It swaps the carrier and modulator input signal everytime a morphing has finished while at the same time routing another audio source into the respectively muted input.
This can easily be done with freeware, too - with up to 12 audio sources!
Here is how:
 this picture shows all softwares needed to fake the AET filter functioning.: a modular host / VST wrapper; Midicurve; RD switch 6×6; DtblkFXs
routing and parameter assignment:

MIDI keyboard into Pd, from Pd to your DAW, inside your DAW rout it into all 'Midicurve'-plugins
rout first and second Midicurves into a 6x6 switch each; assigning 6×6's input switching parameter to the Midi CC coming from the respective Midicurve plug-in
rout third Midicurve to DtblkFXs, assigning it's ""0.Val"" parameter to Midi output CC coming from that respective Midicurve
rout your audio sources (synths / samplers / microphones) into the RD switches - instruments 1,3,5,7 & 9 into one switch and the instruments 2,4,6 & 8 into the other switch (all instruments get a  different input at the RD switches - don't put all of them into the first audio channel, otherwise they won' t morph)
draw the transfer functions of the Midicurves as seen in the picture and make sure to place a hook at ""CC"" and select the CC of your modwheel!
If you turn your modwheel up, now, the switches should change their input channels exactly in the moment when a full morphing from one source to the next has been finished.
adjust DtblkFXs as seen in the picture!

227,Context sequencer v3.0.1,Context sequencer v3.0.1,"Dear PD community
I am happy to announce the beta release of Context, a powerful new sequencer for PD. Context is a modular sequencer that re-imagines musical compositions as a networks. It combines traditional step sequencing and timeline playback with non-linear and algorithmic paradigms, all in a small but advanced GUI.
Unlike most other sequencing software, Context is not an environment. It is a single abstraction which may be replicated and interconnected to create an environment in the form of a network. There are literally endless possibilities in creating Context networks, and the user has a great deal of control over how their composition will function.

From a technical perspective, Context features a lot of things that you don't often see in PD, such as click + drag canvas resizing, dynamic menus, embeddable timelines, and fully automatic state saving. It also boasts its own language, parsed entirely within PD.
Context is work in progress--there are still lots of bugs in the software and lots of holes in the documentation. However, I have gotten it to a place where I feel it is coherent enough for others to use it, and where it would benefit from wider feedback. I am especially looking for people who can help me with proof reading and bug tracking. Please let me know if you want to join the team! Even if you can't commit to much, pointing out typos or bits of the documentation that are confusing will be very helpful to me.
Some notes on the documentation: I have been putting 90% of my efforts recently into writing the manual, and only 9% into writing the .pd help files (the remaining 1% being sleep). The help files are pretty, but  the information in them is not very useful. This will be corrected as soon as I have more time and better perspective. In the mean time, please don't be put off by the confusing help files, and treat the manual as the main resource.
Context is available now at https://github.com/LGoodacre/context-sequencer.

235,Two vanilla delay based patches,Two vanilla delay based patches,"Finalized a delay patch that I've been chasing for a long time. I once had a BOSS RSD-10 that features a pitch following aux input. It acts like a normal delay until it receives a pitched tone on the aux input. It then transposes the length of the buffer by the distance of that pitch from middle C! It's a lot of fun to play with.
I did a lot of pd gymnastics to get the patch to work. There is a part that queues changes in delay time according to the next delay time. That allows the buffer to be read back at the right speed to transpose correctly.
Here's the patchstorage link https://patchstorage.com/keytrails/
There's a video in that page.
I've been working on a pd emulation of a hardware sound I've played with over the past year. I am crazy about the sounds that come out of this setup. I'm wondering if anyone else out there feels the same way.

The concept is a set of keyboard controlled delay based resonators that are fed with a tone that varies greatly in pitch according to a simple sequence. I'm happy with the sonic results in my patch as it currently exists. Some of the engineering a little off. My tone generator seems to ring at 1/5 of the sampling rate, so I put a notch there and it sounds nicer. I'm compensating resonator pitch against the setting of an allpass filter in the feedback loop and the relationship is far from spot-on, it's just set by ear. Maybe you'll like it anyhow.

239,Phase distortion synthesis and viariable sawtooth,Phase distortion synthesis and viariable sawtooth,"Hi all.
Here's a simple attempt at a phase distortion based variable sawtooth.
It differs from classical Casio-style PD synthesis because the phasor distortion node point can be moved not only along the X axis but along the Y axis to.
BTW i notice a slight pitch changing when the node X position is going toward the extreme left or right.
I don't really know the cause. Is it just a psychoacoustic effect because the harmonic content just grows?
Should i nest the whole thing in a subpatcher and use a [ block~ 1]?
Is [ expr~ ] not so precise or too cpu intensive?
thanks

Here is my first synth patch. I used and learned a lot from the pd audio example patches. Its basically the markov sequencer from the AudioMarkov thread. But now the waveform creates not only the melody but also the sound. The sound is generated without markov, but theres a little effect chain. I think there are some interesting sounds. You can also draw the sounds into the array.
If you find any bugs i will try to fix them. I am also happy about any suggestions (optimizing parameter ranges for example).
A switch between poly and mono could be nice.

It works well if the sample has a maximum lenth of 500ms, otherwise the patch starts to slow down.

246,Stomp-board my current project,Stomp-board my current project,"This is a project I started just before Xmas. It was a really just an exercise to see how my nknob.pd abstraction would work in the real world, then morphed into a styling execise.
Stomp-board is a collection of guitar effects vaguely resembling stomp boxes. They can be arranged
and wired in any order and can be repeated as often as required. Each effect is given a unique name
when placing and this name is used to automatically save preset parameters against.
Effects are placed as objects in the normal Pd manner with one argument (eg [digi-delay Delay-1]) and connected with audio wires that should be in line with the round markers (there are fake inlets and outlet to the right as spacers)
As a graphics exercise its a failure because the nknob.pd is very heavy in the template area.
Its almost impossible to delete the effects objects as they grow in number (they will eventually delete though) and it is therefore essential to use the Quit button to end a session. There is a barely started help file.
stomp-board.pd is the demo (see pic), stomp-base.pd is the minimum start point.
I have collected the whole thing including the required externals in a folder Pd-effects-stand-alone
I think out of the box its windows only and in fact I have a folder for Pd 0.48 portable (empty) and a batch file stomp.bat that points to it (you will need to download Millers pd-vanilla portable version to use that)
Points of interest
In stomp-board.pd The looper can automatically record one cycle of drums from four-drums then stop the drums and play the loop and if the guitar is ready then record that on the next cycle
there is a wireless way to send messages to most controls via the unique name + control name
nknob has  a range of 0-100
Any questions, please ask.
I have bash on my 1970's Ibanez strat-copy using this program just about every day

The zip below includes 29+1(raw) standardized effects (esp.) for use with MobMuPlat.
mmp_effs_collection.zip
They all work and have been standardized in the following manner:

all are MMP-compliant (so include only objects which MMP supports)
have 3 inlets and 1 outlet~
the inlets are (from left to right): the incoming signal (i.e. inlet~), the parameters(3), and a switch~
the effects have all been finessed to only include <= 3 parameters
the parameters are sent to the second inlet via [0 $1(, [1 $1(, and [2 $1(
the switch is a toggle so 0|1
and
each window is 186x116 pixels.

I have included an .mmp file to listen to and test them with either adc~ | randomnotes. It also includes a bypass toggle , three parameter knobs (which load the parameter name to each label once an effect is chosen), and a gain. Only the selected effect's switch is turned ""on"" so it is very low on the cpu.

The MMP file, in and of, itself may prove useful to someone as it packages in a single place a 30-effect ""pedal-box"".
That however is not why I am sharing it.
Since the effects are standardized and mmp-compliant, my hope/thinking is others may include them in their work no matter what it may be and thus build their patches, apps, etc., using the effects as building-blocks.
I have accredit the original effects designers by adding a suffix (in parenthesis) to each effect as follows (in alpha-order):
d=DIY2 Collection
g=Guitar Extended
s=Stamp Album Collection
v=scott vanya (me)

I made a patch for giving ""PowerPoint"" like presentations in PD for a workshop I gave recently. It's nothing that fancy, but it does give you the ability to define sections, introduce one line of text at a time, and include hyperlinks. The advantage is that there's a big empty space available for patching, so you won't have to flip between a presentation window and patch. This is, I suppose, the main reason why someone would want to use it.

All instructions for how to use it are included in the template itself. The only thing you need to do in order to get started  is to press the ""bang"" object in the top left. Alternatively, you can click on the toggle and then use the spacebar to advance.
You'll need a few externals for it to run: Zexy, Cyclone, pddp. iemguts (this one's not essential).

Currently, working on a broader project, but this part (at least) (I think) is ready for distribution.
Background: I Really hate leaving the side of my guitar (for example to click a mouse or tweak a setting) when I am playing. So designed this mmp app so that I can attach (with funtack, ex.) my handheld to my guitar and control my settings from there or perhaps even as I play. Like so:

[Aside: the broader project also includes (on the front-side of the app) controls driven by the handheld's tilt, as well as, the adc~ pitch, env~, and distance of the pitch from a ""center"". But that part has to wait (though the code is all inside the mmp_osc2midi_rc.pd patch just disconnected/does not use the cpu).]
SETUP (linux is what I know, so other OSes may work just can't/haven't tested them):
JACK
Pure Data
a2jmidid - JACK MIDI daemon for ALSA MIDI (in the Ubuntu at least repos)
guitarix a/o rakarrack, or other midi-driven effects apps (such as the included set of 30 pd effects(see below))
PIECES:
mmp_osc2midi_rc.zip
The mmp_osc2midi_rc.zip (extract(android)/install(ios) to MobMuPlat directory)
osc2midi_bridge.zip
The osc2midi_bridge.zip (to be run on the ""pd receiver"") and includes the osc2midi_bridge.pd, help file, and a set of 30 mmp-ready-(mono) effects (in the ./effs directory) that can be used if PD is to be used as the receiver. (They are standardized to include 3 inlets: left=inlet~, center=[0 $1(, [1 $1(, [2 $1( messages sent to 3 parameters on the effect, and right=[switch~] and 1 outlet~ and a demo guitarix ""bank"" file called ""MIDITEST.gx"" (which includes 2 presets/programs and set midi values (0-8) to test. Just add the file to the guitarix config ""banks"" folder).
Instructions:

Start Jack;
In Pure Data, open the osc2midi_bridge-help.pd file; toggle ""listen"" on; and set MEDIA to ""ALSA-MIDI"" (the additional pieces are just examples of receiving the midi values);
In Jack>ALSA: Connect Read:MIDI to Write:PD & Read:PD to Write:Midi;
From the command line execute ""a2j_control start"" (no quotes);
Start (ex.) guitarix;
In Jack>Midi connect a2j:Pure Data(capture) to (ex) gx_head_amp:midi_in_1.

Note/Alert/etc. For a machine to receive OSC messages the recipient-computer's firewall must (I believe) be turned off.
GUI:
The GUI has 3 pages that look (basically) as follows (with the subsequent 2 pages having only the 3 knobs and 3 buttons).

The buttons trigger text entry boxes which allow you to enter numbers (0-127) representing:
PGM: the number sent to (midi) [pgm]
and
(the buttons beside the knobs) the midi value, i.e [ctrl] (0-127), each knob is to be sent to (all on channel=0). (The resulting number of which are all written to the label to the left.)
For example:

Results in:

You can now to do 1 of 2 things:
Set the mmp-knobs to whatever midi values you have set in guitarix
or
Set the guitarix midi values (mousewheel click on a control) to one of the mmp preset 0-8 midi values.

WOW!!!
That took a helluva a lot of writing (and reading) but I hope you can both see the value and make use of this bit of technology.
As I said before,
I look forward to being able to fine tune my sound ALL while my hands and I are BOTH still at my guitar and not bend over, move, etc. etc. etc. to get the sound I want.
Peace, Love, and Ever-Lasting Good Cheer.
If you made it this far , Thanks for Listening.
Sincerely and Optimistically,

I've been having a playing around with phase distortion synthesis for the past few days (it seemed fun).
I've had a go at creating a quick 4-note poly with 4 voice synth for MIDI. Each voice is on a separate MIDI channel for listening on the IAC Bus from Logic (I'm using the .mid files for Doom).
I've created two ways for generating the phase table (ramp1 & ramp2). The first one is for simply modulating a linear ramp, the second for a complex ramp with option to flip between the two for all voices.
The wave table lookup (array: wave) is a cosinsum with the option to switch to sinesum and square.
Have a play around and let me know if there is any way to make it better/more efficient and thoughts. I've not kept to the strict best practices ($0-) but it should work out of the box.

It's standard fare, shooting down a helicopter with an AK47  Recently I tidied it up into a more presentable visual form so people can learn from it more easily and I posted it on my site as an addition to my games showreel.
I also put up some separate patches of sound design, from tutorials I am working on for games and film sound designers, stuff like fire, water, exploding cars. The patches themselves are not yet well documented with the theory and methods of design, but they are at least commented.
You'll need a few extens to use them, but I've tried to document the dependencies.
Hopefully I will get time to work finishing the writing which explains how all these are made and how to use the same general principles to design any sound.
Anyway, meanwhile feel free to pick through them and experiment. Have fun.

sig-setter~-help.pd
sig-setter~.pd
Preface: I have been doing a lot of work recently setting up an electric guitar as an ""arduino guitar"" (with additional knobs, switches, etc.) to run my patches.
Occurred to me a couple of days ago (while considering buying a second ard to make a guitar for a friend), I could harness sigmund~ to just capture pitch (as digital values) and envelope (as the analog values) without ever changing the inside of the guitar.
The result is this patch.
Instructions:
The [ON] toggle triggers a [switch~] and would be used during setup and (probably) not performance (without severely cramping one's playing style).
The grid of hradios represent the fret board (in standard guitar tuning). Low on the bottom, high on the top.
The first three (bottom hradios) strings (low-E,A,D) run from midi-pitch 40 thru 54. So if you play for example pitches 40-44, it changes the first string hradio between the values of 1 and 5. The A and D strings do the same but for their respective hradios. (The first 6 outlets (from left to right) represent the 6 strings).
The three high strings also capture hradio values. But in the special case of being in ""open"", (using the [env~], in other words how loudly you play the note) they send analog values between the range of 0 and 1 (as shown in the val0, val1, and val2 sliders and are sent to the right three outlets). So if you play the note loud it sets the parameter/slider closer to 1, softer closer to 0.

The ""threshold"" (sigmund~ minpower param) is used to filter for ambient noise and add sensitivity control and defaults to 66. So it can be set to capture the softer sounds and change the range of the analog values. (It's max is 100. Changing that value would need to be done internally within the patch).

I am pretty sure if configured properly, this makes my arduino guitar idea mute.
On the other hand, I love to play with knobs and switches  so am Not going to abandon that tool for this patch.

However, I think this patch might prove useful to others.
If not to actually use, then at least for the sake of an idea-generator about how to use the fretboard (potentially instead) of arduino to set param values.

Happy Pd-ing,
Scott
p.s. This is setup to use standard guitar tuning but other tunings could easily be fashioned.
You can see the effect in action by clicking on the messages (which represent (midi) pitches)) at the top right of the help file. Changing the ""gain(log)"" before clicking a message impacts the analog values.
p.p.s. Sorry, it's so large, but my eye-sight is very poor and this scale just makes things a helluva a lot easier on me.
afterward:
If it bounces between values on you, try (in this order): a cleaner sound (un-effected), changing the threshold, or if necessary the parameters inside the sigmund~ object.","[{""text"": ""sig-setter~-help.pd"", ""link"": ""/uploads/files/1505642632548-sig-setter-help.pd""}, {""text"": ""sig-setter~.pd"", ""link"": ""/uploads/files/1505642638280-sig-setter.pd""}]"

283,Kangtaum - Scriptophonic microtonal metal generator,Kangtaum - Scriptophonic microtonal metal generator,"Kangtaum.zip
_
_
Kangtaum is an attempt at a real-time implementation of the text-to-(Black Metal)music algorithm proposed by Dave Tremblay.
The algorithm was intended for use with Tolkien’s writing; this version will produce a microtonal scriptophonic ‘metal’ composition from any text file that is input. The default is the poem She Bomber by Eliza Gregory, the text currently being converted is output to the Pd window.
_
_
_
Here's how it works:
·The octave is divided in 26 equal steps (26 microtones, one for each letter).
·The ordering of the letters, from low to high, is:
E-O-V-I-Q-C-F-A-J-Z-P-H-B-Y-S-R-K-D-T-L-X-M-N-G-W-U based on their frequency of use in the sample text (Tolkein).
·One letter represents a duration of 1/8th note.
·One comma, parenthesis or semicolon is a ‘tie’ to the last note played (1/8th duration normally) is continued for a ¼.
·A full stop, colon, exclamation or question mark is a pause of 1/8th measure.
·There are three transcription tracks:

The melody: It is each letter and punctuation in the text played one after the other.
The chords: A chord lasts as long as a word in the melody (for example, a three-letter word will last 3 eights notes, and a nine-letter word will last 9 eights). It's comprised of all the different notes/letters of the word played at once.
The bass: The bass track or chord root consists of the first letter of each word played for the duration of the word. For example, the words THAN and NATH have the same notes and length, but the root and melody of the chords will be different).

·Reverberation for the composition is inversely proportional to the size of the current text chunk or sentence being converted into music. The bigger the chunk, the smaller the virtual space.
·The stereo position of the melody is controlled by the length of the word currently being sonified.
·A counterpoint line is generated from a reordering of the current word/chord’s notes from low to high, which is arpeggiated. The balance between melody and counterpoint is controlled by word length. The longer the word the more melody is present.

This isn't a finished patch, i've kind of reached a dead end with it so thought I'd open it up and see if any one else would like to chip in. I'm really interested in developing the synthesis side of things and making it sound more METAL I suppose.
If nothing else, hopefully some of the list processing is useful to someone working to convert text to music. Many thanks to those on the forum that helped me work some of it out or provide solutions.

DynamicEffectPluginLoaderForPI.zip
Background:
In the last couple of days I finally built something I have needed and wanted for a while (which later on I will discuss in more detail under a separate thread): an Arduino electric guitar.
In other words, I took the connections off the 5-way and knobs (internally connected to the pickups and line out) and rerouted the switch and knobs to an arduino. The reasoning being I can control Way more with pd and those knobs than what they were originally intended to do if I capture their output using Arduino.
However, the patch I had built for it was clocking in at about 275-300% of the pi's cpu. And while I could have gone back and added switches (which I took out a while back, to replace with fade-mixers for when I change an effect) throughout, the thought of doing that was more daunting than (considering how elaborate the patch is) I wanted to undertake.
Enter: Dynamic Patching.
I found that with just 3 straight-chained effects the pi ran at only about 10%.
So...here's what I built and am sharing now (before tying it into the arduino guitar, because I think others might want to go ahead and learn from it, extend it, expand upon it, use it, etc. etc.).
The patch(es, there are two, one laid out for the DIY2 plugins and one laid out for the Stamp Album ones, will probably consolidate them later, but other things are demanding my attention) is pretty straight forward:
(Dependency on the tof/menubutton, tof can be found via deken)
Click on the menus at the top to select an effect for each of the 5 slots or select the ""unchanged"" effect to leave that slot open.
Then click the BUILD bang or the CLEAR bang (to start over).
The selected effects will load into the PALLETTE subpatch already connected to adc~ and dac~.

That's really about all there is to it. Very straight-forward, clean, and very cpu light-weight. The racks of all 5 slots I tested ran at about 10-12% on my PI 3r2.

Hope you can make use of it. And would love to hear feedback.

For the future:
Add a hid-stomp controller to load preset racks (which you can send in via the tof/menubotton) to load racks on the fly;
Add a meta-level to send either hid, osc, or arduino commands to each of the loaded effects.

Merry Music to us, one and all.
Peace,
Scott
p.s. Oh! The arduino guitar: though it has no connected pickups it gets its audio signal from an (about) 1"" piezo mic fun-tacked to the knob-well inside the guitar. Sounds great. Just pure guitar. The tone, texture, etc. come after the fact via the pd-side.
Ciao for now.
Wanna say: the real genius lies not in what I cobbled together, but the strength of will and purpose it took for the two original developers to make abstractions so completely consistent and thoroughly aligned.

Background:
Currently I am doing a lot of work (using Anduril+elvencloak+and 2 player+recorder abstractions, links to the musical pieces are at the bottom (too many to share here)) with ""self-driven"" remixes. (The plan is one day it will be me as I play driving those abs.)
Meaning:
I play a piece; send it thru Anduril (with randomly selected effects (14) (generally speaking correctly gain-balanced) and randomly selected fade-in/out times); and then turn elvencloak on or off (in which case I then manually manipulate the parameters).
Since the 14 effects have all been chosen because they have only 3+gain parameters (4 more are in the process of being added (body-resonance (diy2), filter (StampAlbum), noisegate (StampAlbum), & my beat-looper, they could theoritically all be controlled via one 3-d controller.
I considered (pursued) using a handheld's gyroscope/acceleremeter to manipulate the effects, then thought of how I might use a joy/flight-stick to do it if I converted the 2 xy coordinates to polar (theta and ro). (So use two values (coordinates) to create 3 values.)
So...
The patch is a visualization tool to help me learn and hopefully master the use of a 3-d footpedal (by cutting off the stick and inserting a plane of wood, which I;ve talked about elsewhere on the forum).
To use it/see what it is doing you need:
GEM + a joystick;
once you plug in your joystick select it from the hradio and click the green box to turn on HID;
then click the Create button to open the gem window.
As you move the joystick, the subsphere will move around the larger sphere and the three quasi-sliders (from left-to-right: x, y, and z) will move up and down to represent the 2d-to-3d conversion.
To be honest, I still can't digest how it moves. But as is the case with many of my patches I made it to see how it might work.
Note:
Hope you enjoy it. And as the values are all scaled to -4 to 4, it is ready to be used if you want to create a 3d footpedal for your self.
The inv toggle flips the ""polarity"" of the functions, as I got them from Wikipedia (in the calculations subpatch) and it said the ones they had listed were Not the traditional physics ones. The physics ones are toggle=1 and toggle=0 are the Wikipedia ones (really just relating to which values get plotted to x or y).

p.s. for further testing I am going to be doing remixes of a Hopi (Indian) song, whales, and Gyoto Monk chants. So you might (if you like them check up on the site).
Hopefully, those will be done with me ""driving"" the app(s) using the footpedal so I can better learn how I might use it in a live/improv environment.

It includes:
a 5-band EQ (on page 2 of the app) (upfront that is applied to all incoming sounds);
a looper: with record, forward, backward, speed, and bypass controls (that runs via a throw along with the effects channel)
14 effects each with 3 controllable parameters (via the xy-slider+centered knob) including: chorus, distortion, delay, reverb, flanger, tremolo, vibrato, vcf, pitchshifter, pitchdelay, 12string, stepvibrato, pushdelay (delayfb driven by magnitude of the env~), and stagdelay (2 out-of-sync delay lines which can be driven in and out of phase by the sum of their delwrite+vd's so what goes in first may come out last)
elven_cloak: which drives the 3 parameter controls via the peak bands amplitude and proximity to a set pitch (midi note) and whose window can be broadened or shrunk and shifted within that window, i.e. the three effect parameters are changed automatically according to what and how you play
and
a tester synth: that randomly sends midi pitches between 20-108, velocities between 20-127, and durations between 250-500ms.

Effect: effects menu where the you choose an effect;
>>>,<<<: page navigation buttons;
IN,OUT: gains (IN is the preamp on the EQ5, and OUT is applied to total output);
REC,FWD,BWD,speed,normspd: the looper toggles and on speed, higher is faster and mid normal and normspd resets to mid;
xy-slider+centered knob: the 3 parameter controls + their labels (the bottom is x, top y and above the knob for the third one), the name of the selected effect and its parameters load each time you choose from the Effects menu, bottom left is lowest, top-right highest;
ByLp,ByEff: bypasses for the looper and effects ""channel"" (the outputs are summed);
EC-on: elven cloak toggle (default=off);
PAGE 2:
the EQ5 controls;
synthtest: off|on, default is off;
PAGE 3: elven cloak controls
reset: sets shift, metro, mid, and radius to 0, 500(ms),64,100% respectively (i.e. the entire midispectrum, 0-127) respectively;
mini-xyz, test: if test is on, you see a miniature representation of the xyz controls on the first page, so you can calibrate the cloak to your desired values;
shift: throws the center of the range to either the left or right(+/-1);
metro: how frequently in milliseconds to take env~ readings;
mid: the center in midipitch, i.e. 0-127, of the ""watched"" bands
radius(%): the width of the total bands to watch as a percentage of whichever is lower 1-mid or mid
END CONTROLS
Basic Logic:
There are 4 modes according to the bypass state of the looper and effects.
A throw catch and gain/sum/divide is applied accordingly.

As I mentioned at the first, my handheld(s) are not good enough to let me use this but it runs great on my laptop.
So...
I would love to hear if this Does or Does Not work for others and even better any output others might make using it. I am enormously curious to hear what is ""possible"" with it.
Presets have not (yet  been included as I see it, esp. with the cloak as a tool to be used for improv and less set work. Tho I think it will work nicely for that too if you just turn the cloak off.
hmmm, hmmm,...
I think that's about it.
Let me know if you need any help, suggestions, ideas, explanations, etc. etc. etc. regarding the tool. I would be more than happy to share what I learned.

The Harmonizer
The Harmonizer is a single or multi-player mini-moog synthesizer played over a shared LAN.
(credits: The original ""minimoog"" patch is used by permission from Jaime E. Oliver La Rosa at the the New York University, Music Department and NYU Waverly Labs (Spring 2014) and can be found at: http://nyu-waverlylabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/minimoog.zip)
One or more players can play the instrument with each player contributing to one or more copies of the synthesizer (via the app installed on each handheld) depending on whether they opt to play ""player 1"" or ""player 2"".
By default, all users are ""player 1"" so any changes to their app, ex. changing a parameter, playing a note, etc., goes to all other players playing ""player 1"".
If a user is ""player 2"", then their notes, controls, mod-wheel etc. are all still routed to the network, i.e. to all ""player 1""'s, but they hear no sound on their own machine.

There are 2 pages in The Harmonizer. (See screenshots below.)
TheHarmonizer.zip
PAGE 1:

PAGE 2:

The first page of the app contains all controls operating on a (more or less) ""meta""-level for the player: in the following order (reading top-left to bottom-right):
pl2: if selected (toggled) the user is choosing to play ""player 2""
mot(ion): triggers system motion controls of the osc1,2&3 levels (volume) based on the accelerometer inside the smartphone (i.e as you twist and turn the handheld in your hand the 3 oscs' volumes change)
rate: how frequently should the handheld update its accelerometer data
slimit: by how much should the app slow down sending the (continuous) accelerometer data over the network
presets: from 1 to 5 preset ""save-slots"" to record and reload the Grid 1 and Grid 2 settings that are currently active
S: save the current Grid1 and Grid2 selections to the current ""save slot""
L: load the currently selected preset into both Grids
"">>"": go the the next page (page 2 has the reverse, a ""<<"" button)
Grid 1: the settings, in 4 banks of 3 parameters per-, which are labeled top-down equating to left-right
Grid 2: the same as Grid 1, but with a different set of parameters
The second page comprises:
the 2-octave keyboard (lower notes on top),
a 9-button octave grid (which can go either up or down 4 octaves),
a quick-preset grid which loads one of the currently saved 5 presets
the ""<<"" button mentioned above, and
both a mod and pitch-bend wheel (as labeled).
SETUP:
All players install Mobmuplat;
Receive The Harmonizer (in the form of a .zip file either via download or thru email, etc.)
When on your smartphone, click on the zip file, for example, as an attachment in an email.
Both android and iphone will recognize (unless you have previously set a default behavior for .zip files) the zip file and ask if you would like to open it in Mobmuplat. Do so.
When you open Mobmuplat, you will be presented with a list of names, if in android click the 3 dots in the top right of the window and on the settings window , click ""Network"" Or on an iphone click ""Network"" just below the name list;
On the Network tab, click ""LANDINI"".
Switch ""LANDINI"" from ""off"" to ""on"".
(this will allow you to send your control data over your local area network with anyone else who is on that same LAN).
From that window, click ""Documents"".
You will be presented again, with the previous list of names.
Scroll down to ""TheHarmonizer"" and click on it.
The app will open to Page 1 as described and shown in the image above.
Enjoy with Or without Friends, Loved, Ones, or just folks who want to know what you mean ""is possible"" with Pure Data )!

Theories of Thought on the Matter
My opinion is:
While competition could begin over ""who controls"" the song, in not too great a deal of time, players will see first hand, that it is better (at least in this case) to work together than against one another.
If any form of competition emerges in the game, for instance loading a preset when a another player was working on a tune or musical idea, the Overall playablilty and gratitude-level will wain.
However, on the other hand, if players see the many, many ways one can constructively collaborate I think the rewards will be far more measurable than the costs, for instance, one player plays notes while the other player plays the controls.
p.s. my thinking is:
since you can play solo: it will be fun to create cool presets when alone then throw them into the mix once you start to play together. (Has sort of a card collecting fee ).

Afterward:
This was just too easy Not to do.
It conjoins many aspects of pure data together (I have been working on lately (afterward: i did this app a long time ago but for some reason and am only now thinking to share it) both logistical and procedural into a single whole.
I think it does both quite well, as well as, offer the user an opportunity to consider or perhaps even wonder: What is 'possible'?""
Always share. Life is just too damn short not to.
Love only.

This is one of the early projects by @Jona and me. Happy to finally release it. 
markovGenerator
Generates music from learned material using Markov chains. It is polyphonic, plays endlessly and supports Markov chains with variable length.
markovGenerator.zip  (updated)
Usage:

Record midi notes or load midi files
Make Markov system
Play




Record midi notes or load midi files
Until you reset the memory, each new recording will be added to the memory. The recorded material is seen as a loop, so that the last note is followed by the the first note, for endless play. markovGenerator handles recording midi and loading midi files differently: When you record midi, it will record notes according to the midi clock every sixth midi tick. This is defined in the counter in [pd midiclock]. So that way, breaks are being recorded and the rhythm is preserved. When loading midi files, no breaks are being recorded, the notes are just recorded in order, so the rhythm will be lost. In any case, simultaneous notes will be recorded as chords, so polyphony is preserved.


Make Markov system
Set markovOrder to specify the length of the Markov chain. The higher the order, the more musical information will be kept, the lower the order, the more random it gets. You can use soundFilter and channelFilter to only use notes of the specified sound or channel. This is especially useful when working with midi files. Note that if there are no notes of the specified sound or channel, the Markov system will be empty and nothing will be played. Set the filters to zero to disable them. If you change the settings for the Markov system, click makeMarkov again for them to take effect. You can make new Markov systems with different settings out of the same recorded material over and over again, even when playing. If you record additional notes, click makeMarkov again to incorporate them into the Markov system.


Play
While playing, you can change the note length, sound and midi out channel. Set soundOut and channelOut to zero to use the sound and channel information of the original material. Playing starts with the Markov chain of the last recorded notes, so the first note might be played first.


Use the markovAll section on the right to control all Markov channels at once. Here you can also set tempo, swing and midiSync, and you can save the project or load previous projects.
Have fun! 
If it does not play, make sure that

you recorded some notes,
you hit the makeMarkov button,
soundFilter and channelFilter are not set to values where there are no notes. Try setting the filters to zero and hit makeMarkov again.

About the Markov system:
You can see the Markov system of each Markov channel in [text define $0markov]. Notes are stored as symbols, where the values are joined by ""?"". A note might look like 42?69?35?10 (pitch?velocity?sound?channel). Chords are joined by ""="". A chord of two notes might look like 40?113?35?10=42?49?35?10. Notes and chords are joined to Markov chains by ""-"". The velocity values are not included in the chains. Sound and midi channel values are only included, if soundFilter or channelFilter are off, respectively. Markov chains of order three may look like 42?35?10-36?35?10=42?35?10-60?35?2 with filters off and simply like 42-37-40 with both filters active, only using the pitch value.

Anyway it didn't work under windows so while I was updating old drum machines I sorted this one out.

Here's the instructions, which are also under the Balwyn button.
Wavetable Drum Machine
Balwyn 2015
8 x bank of 64 amplitude sliders, each bank runs in sync driven by a clock. The clock has 16 start/end settings plus a repeat cycles setting, there is also a Vradio block to set the return position.
The mixer block has 8 x level & pan settings with stereo to the dac~
The wave selector is for loading the individual wav files to the relevant drum line. The *.wav files must be stored in the 'waves' folder within the program folder and selected from there.
Saving must be saved to the 'pattern' folder within the program folder. Save the file with one word and no extension, a file of that name will be created for the pattern settings. Another file with the same name will also be created with the extension '.kit', this stores the names of the wave files.
Loading must be from the 'pattern' folder within the program folder. All the clock, pattern and wave files will be updated. select only the file WITHOUT the .kit extension, otherwise nothing will load and soundfiler errors will appear in the Pd window.
The clear button will clear all the amplitude sliders, set all the clock settings to 1 except BPM which is set to 500.
The supplied samples were recorded via Audacity from Qsynth. Ditch them for your own

All of this was contingent on the foundation and resources laid out in the DIY2 and Stamp Album collections and actually this was largely an example of persistence not any real insight and the largest percentage of the success goes to their creators for being so diligent about standardizing their abstractions.
I DO however hope you find it useful.
My GOAL was to eliminate what is often the case with effect stacks (I have seen) of having to connect all the effects. This eliminates that and makes it much cleaner: only having to select from the (tof/pmenu POPUP_LIST button) or navigate to the desired effect with the standard ""first, previous, next, last"" controls.
I hope you find the work useful and capable of helping you to manifest all those wonderful sounds you have in your head.

316,Randomizing the order of a list,Randomizing the order of a list,"Hello, I am new to PD and am attempting to create a sequencer where, after the user (me) enters the scale notes (as numbers in a list), they can be reorganized instantly with a single click. I've almost got a workaround that works, but my patch currently relies on list append and list split 1 cycling back into it... when it reaches the cycle at the end of the measure it adds an extra beat. I can just subtract a beat from the count to even it out, but then my last two notes in the sequence are always the same, and that's no good.
If I could just instantly reorganize the original list my patch would be much more elegant. Is this possible somehow?",[]

I have a very strange problem right now.
i have 3  dataflow strings passing through a route object using
three |x set $1( messages.
it looks like this.

so far no problem as you see the numbers come out of the route object as they supposed to.
but if i now want to go on working with the numbers the flow stops.

i have no idea why this could be.
connecting things directly to the route object works fine. working with the data before the route object is also no problem.
but in the second instance after the route object the flow stops abrupt.
someone has an idea?

I am new to pure data, and I want to find out if the project I have in mind is something that can be done relatively easy with pure data or if I have to search for another option. Have in mind that I am not a profesional programmer (altough I do have some experiance with VB.net) and that I would like to see results in about 100 working hours.
What I want is to create (I did not find anything created yet) a patch that can recieve Artnet commands to display video files. I´ve been testing VTP7 (max based) these weeks, but this does not accept Artnet commands as an input (so I have to convert them first in MIDI) and it stucks when I try to run larger video files (896x448px). Furthermore VTP7 has many options that I do not need since I want to control all from my lighting desk.
I have been searching for the main parts of this patch (Artnet_in and (multi) video display) but without any luck. I don´t expect anyone to directly solve this issue for me, but I hope that someone can tell me if Pure Data is the right tool to achieve my goal and (if so) where to start.

it needs to  the send and all other note it should not send

It really is as fast and simple as it looks in the animation!
The bad news is that this function doesn't fully work on Vanilla yet (it should do when [initbang] is included in the next Vanilla release). Until then, it definitely works in Extended and should work in L2Ork, although I haven't tested it. Vanilla users can still use it, but the connections will be broken when the object is created, unlike in the gif.

326,Super Mario Sound Effects Reproduction,Super Mario Sound Effects Reproduction,"Hello there, It's been a while since i've posted properly and used Pd in any capacity. So i decided to set my self a little challenge.
I decided to try and recreate some of the sound effects from the Super Mario games. I got the sound effects from this soundboard specifically Fireball, Jump, Power-up and Warp Pipe. I've linked my patches here for people to have a look at and point me in the right direction for being more efficient with the sound creation and coding process.
mario_fireball.pd
Mario_jump.pd
mario_power_up.pd
Mario_warppipe.pd
The process involved bouncing the audio out of the soundboard, then analysing the file in Izotope RX. From there i could identify things like which wave form to use (square) everything from frequencies, note duration, envelopes and anything else. Initially I had used an infinite bandwidth squarewave but that proved to bright against the original so went with a bandlimited square wave using sinesum. The biquad is a lowpass filter dialed in using [lowpass] and [tanh~] is there just for a little distortion.
But i've hit a brick wall with the 'Yoshi Mount' effect. I think it's something like amplitude modulation with a modulated carrier (FM come AM) based on what i can see:
  (an example of the wave form)
does anyone have a few pointers for me, any feedback would be great.
Feel free to use the patches where ever, they're just a bit of fun.

At the moment, it just handles equal-tempered scales. I've found 5-tet and 7-tet really nice for jamming, as you get a similar harmony to the slendro and pelog scales used in gamelan.
I've included a state-saving function allowing maps to be stored and loaded - It writes all the floats to a text file to be read back again, and seems to work quite well. The default filepath can be changed, but of course, spaces in the filepath will cause an error.
There's probably a bit of customisation needed - You'll probably have to move a few keys around if you want to use it yourself, as your keypad is likely to have have a slightly different layout. Also, I've only got one type of sound loaded, but you can add your own easily enough. I'd like to develop it as a sort of MIDI controller for playing external synth patches eventually, but here's the first draft.

a string in the name and 2) certain files that include a

The reason being: that pd is best learned (if not watching
those awesome youtube tutorials) by actually looking at and
amending other people's code to suit your own.
With that in mind, I built the follow simple, [shell]
object-empowered patch which does just that:
The symbols on the left are the search paths (which are
embedded (and changeable within the patch thru simple
messages) and the toggles on the right of them determine if
that path is to be searched.
Click the bang on the left of the search string, and the
wonderful (the name of the creator of which escapes me):
input_text_simple.pd pops up and you type in the message the
search string and push the ENTER key on your keyboard.
Next bang either: the FIND-FILENAME or FIND-INSIDE ""srch""
bangs and the results will be output to the Console.
Since the output is sent to the console it could of course
then be scraped, manipulated, slice&diced and whatever
fashion you want.

The Malinette is a software and a hardware set. The software part is mainly two things:

a set of objects to learn Pure Data easily for children, students, artists, ...;
a framework to help you programming interactivity.

The website is quite outdated : http://reso-nance.org/malinette

It would be nice to have some comments, feedbacks of the beta version, that you can find here : https://git.framasoft.org/resonance/malinette/repository/archive.zip?ref=master
Note that we are using Pd-extended, we need all these libraries : initbang, Gem, zexy, cyclone, moonlib, moocow, hcs, tof, comport, iemlib, iemnet or oscx or mrpeach, motex, ggee, list-abs, mapping
If you never tried the Malinette, you can find some features here : http://reso-nance.org/malinette/en/software/features

I am not a musician, so some of the terms in this patch will be incorrect.  I threw it together this evening because it will make my life easier......
I have a group of classical musicians that often play to click, and they play a piece over six minutes long with an accumulative loop.  Using Fruity Loop Studio I had to count my way through the piece whilst mixing......so as to kill the loop and the click as the piece ended....... a bit painful.  That could probably be automated in FL, but I know Pd better.
The click runs for the number of patterns required, and the looped playback stops automatically.  There is a different first beat for the last pattern in case the musicians get lost.
The bpm, count-in bars, beats per bar, bars per pattern, and the number of patterns can be set, and if the patch is then saved their values will be saved as well........
For each of the parameters in the box type the number you wish and press enter.
It's not very pretty, and you will need headphones, or an earpiece to use it unless you mute the click and count along with the metronome visual, but it works.........

I am an overtone singer and some years ago I needed an interactive table of reference to hear the harmonics and how their intervals sound.
This patch was born for my personal use and it is a prototype.
Since your interesting discussions in this forum have been very important for the implementation of my ideas, it is only right to share my work with you.
What is this?
The Harmonync is a platform that allow the user/musician to play the Harmonic Series and changing its fundamental tone in real-time. Just like the overtone singers do with the polyphonic overtone singing technique.
The idea is to play a fundamental-variable harmonic series on electronic and electro-acoustical instruments retuned via MIDI and in real-time.
The name come from the union of the words “Harmonic” and “Sync”.
The Harmonync can retune MIDI instruments via Pitch Bend Change messages or using the MIDI Tuning Standard (SysEx) protocol.
Actually the Harmonync is prototyped as a patch for Pure Data using the Extended Libraries. The first release was developed with Pd-extended 0.43.4 for Mac OS X but it should run on other platforms.
Get it & More infos
Visit harmonync.org for the updated Download links and the Tutorials. For any questions, you may discuss here or contact me on the project site.
Further developments
The patch is published under the Afffero General Public License v.3.0 (AGPLv3).

380,ALFALOOP 0.1.2,ALFALOOP 0.1.2,"Hi everyone!
Thanks to you all for this great forum.
I sure learned a lot here! I'm glad to finally present some work of mine, too...
ALFALOOP is a dynamic looper I've developed with PD Vanilla 0.42.6.
I call it a ""non-sticky looper"" since it allows you to change its loop-length at any time.
ALFALOOP let's you do basically anything related to looping, such as:

super short loops of a few milliseconds (that would be a delay...)
volume-control of the loop in a delayish way (feedback). This results in a ""forgettable"" looper.
recording while overdubbing and vice-versa
free time-shift (make your loop shorter/longer, incl. adjustment of the level of the previous recordings)
sidechain-compressing of the loop by the input-signal
proper latency-correction
etc...

ALFALOOP has four main-buttons: recording, overdubbing, feedback and ducking.
If you assign these four buttons to midi-controllers, you don't need to watch the computers
screen. Everything can be achieved by using these four controllers. You can assign midi or key controllers simply by ""touching"" like in Ableton and such.
There are plenty of settings-parameters to play around with, like:

crossfade-length
crossfade-offset
fade-in/out-time of the input-signal
fade-in/out-time of the previous recording while overdubbing (ducking-level)
automated overdubbing (threshold)
pre-recording-time (like: 50ms before you hit your controller, scary, isn't it?)
etc..
All the settings get stored automatically.

My goal was that people with little knowledge of PureData (or computers in general) can easily use it too. ALFALOOP features a lot of on-screen-info.
To make sure the GUI looks more or less the same on every platform only canvases were used as visible gui-objects. I did my best to clean everything up and make it look neat...
The main-engine is a built out of a mixture of delays and tables. In a future release, I will document the subpatches.
There is still a lot to do, of course. But now I feel more like making some music...

For the script to work, you need to install python-ladspa.
I have generated all the patches for my system, so for most people, you won't even need to generate the patches. They are located in the ladspa dir (install this in a pd lib dir).
You can check out how it works with demo.pd. demo.mid is a seq24 midi score.
plugins.txt is the info that the script spits out, when you run it, you can use it as reference when making your own patches.
You will probably need to fine-tune the generated patches, because the ladspa meta-data for control inputs isn't always accurate and sometimes a toggle is better then a slide, for example (see demo.pd for a few examples of tuned patches).
My demo patch also illustrates using midi record on/off messages.
The demo is simple and pretty noisy, I just threw it together.

387,kick drum synth module,kick drum synth module,"A single-oscillator kick drum synthesizer. This patch is meant to work as an abstraction. On the ""pitch"" side of the module, the starting frequency, ending frequency, and ramp time between them can be adjusted. One the ""amp"" side, the decay and final gain can be adjusted, as well as the harshness of softness of the initial ""click"" of the kick. I'm not sure if I'm completely satisfied with this ""click"" function yet, as it is simply the initial  jump-time to the peak amplitude. Perhaps adding another waveform here would produce better ""click"" results. Suggestions are much obliged.
As of now, the module simply takes a bang in its inlet and outputs the audio result. Inlets could, of course, be added in order to modulate the parameters of the kick.
Thanks, @LiamG, for the elegant state-saving solution. I've modified the code to fit the parameters of this abstraction, but the design worked marvellously. It also opens up a lot of possibilities, since multiple instances of the abstraction can be saved in their different states by saving the parent patch.
One thing to try might be mixing different instances together--with their own unique settings--to get richer textures. For example, you might try tuning and mixing a high, mid, and sub instance together to get a kick that covers more of the frequency spectrum.
Cheers.

You create as many instances of the abstraction as you want, and then connect them together to create your own patterns (hence its ""modular"" nature). Context is designed with generative music in mind, and can incorporate randomness at any level of musical composition.

I’ve recently got myself a Casio CZ-1, and looking for an editor I came across the one at https://coffeeshopped.com/cz-touch

Now, apparently this editor was made for the CZ-101 type of synths, and the CZ-1 has a different sysex implementation.. Anyway, for me it seems to work on my CZ-1, although some of the features unique to the CZ-1 are not present since I wouldn’t know which bits to edit for that. Any insights on this would be greatly appreciated, or if anyone feels like improving the patch in any way at all that would be great!

Gm Program Changer, with the basic 128 instruments in the 16 categories and a channel changer using the popup external. Also a rudimentary way of accessing the generators within a soundfont (*.sf2) via NRPN. Rudimentary means BE CAREFUL in this case as all notes-off/controllers-off does not necessarily work in this case and the quickest way out is to close fluidsynth/Qsynth or other soundfont player when things go wobbly
Every sliders range is -8192 to 8192, however the effective range may be 0-127, therefore shift-drag may be the go. Pitch adjustments are 100 cents/semitone 1200 = 1 octave. Section 8 of sfspec24.pdf is useful here. However no save or load yet, so this is basically a learning toy
A way to use this patch to control a soundfont player
Assumes Linux, Jack (QjackCtl), alsa for midi and the existence of fluidsynth

Then In a terminal type:- fluidsynth /usr/share/sounds/sf2/SGM-V2.01.sf2 to fire up fluidsynth. open QjackCtl make the connections in audio [fluidsynth #### to system], then in alsa connect your [midi-in to pure data] and [pure data to fluidsynth] Alternatively setup Qsynth with the SGM-V2.01.sf2 and connect jack similarly

After using the MEH-SYSTEM several times, on stage... I upload the 1.0 ""DJ-MEH"" version, with GPL license! This is the exact version that I use in my show ""Mario Mey & Pinokio 3D-Circus"". It has some personal commands... but they don't affect the correct function of MEH-SYSTEM (personal commands at bottom of specifications).
You can watch the entire acting here. Sorry, I speak argentine spanish, but you will understand the point.

About MEH-SYSTEM... it's a bit complex to explain all the functions and specs, but I will try...
8 stereo record banks, 32 seconds max each.
4 recording modes: SAMPLE, RESAMPLE, ""LOOPING"" and OVERDUB.
2 FX CONSOLES controlled by XYpads, HOLD button, DEPTH fader, etc.
100 (and more) effects for each FX console (almost the same KP3 effects).
Controlled by TouchOSC interface, on Android ( ""meh_system5.touchosc"" interface included in ZIP) (sorry Hexler, I didn't paid for it).
Mic in: has EQ3 (for using different types of mics) and LIMITER.
Recording modes:
SAMPLE: it uses predefined BPM to record in 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 beats, using Mic as input.
RESAMPLE: same as SAMPLE, but it uses everything (FX, Mic and Banks) as input.
""LOOPING"": uses the Boss LooperStation recording Style. To use this mode, no bank must be playing. Clicking (or tapping) the button, it starts recording. Clicking again, it stops recording and starts playing. Taking the amount of beats, MEH-SYSTEM defines the new BPM.
OVERDUB: while, at least, one bank is playing, it start recording in the same bank ""overdubbing"". Also, it can be activated as Stop button using ""LOOPING"" mode. (it uses ipoke2~, compiled for Linux64).
FX Consoles modes:
1. Mic & Banks -> FX1 -> FX2 -> Output
2. Mic -> FX1 -> Output, Banks -> FX2 -> Output
3. Banks -> FX1 -> Output, Mic -> FX2 -> Output
4. Mic -> Output, Banks -> FX1 -> FX2 -> Output
5. Banks -> Output, Mic -> FX1 -> FX2 -> Output
First 2 Banks: have LIMITER (every bank can has it, it's like this for optimization, I only need those)
Output: has LIMITER and EQ7 (actually, I don't use the EQ).
MEH-SYSTEM uses original or modified abstracts from: DIY2 FXs (by Matt Davey, I love him), eq7.mmb~ (by Maelstorm), CMETRONOME (I think by Chris Edward, posted by screwtop), RJDJ-vocoder, VLFO (by don't know who), and don't remember other...

Upon listening to actual recordings of ocean sounds, I've decided that what it's missing is a trickling sound for when the waves recede. Not entirely sure how to go about that, but that's probably the next step to up the realism level.

""Deca-Delay"" (uses 10 instances of [delread~] with variable time separating each one, and volume for each)
A more standard delay
Soft-clipping distortion which averages [clip~] and the unaltered signal
Reverb
(also a vocoder that doesn't work yet - advice welcome!!!)

Everything is arranged in a predetermined order just for the sake of having a simple layout, but I should note that it's sometimes fun to reroute the tremolo effects prior to the envelope wah, as it gives a cool LFO wah effect.

406,Text from one file on different lines in GEM,Text from one file on different lines in GEM,"A patch for GEM that reads text from on file and separates it over two gemheads. The idea is to have one source textfile and to display different parts of the text on different lines at the same time or subsequently. Because it has one source file the text stays in sync.
Work in progress so any comments for improvements please. (see Pixel forum) For instance I am still looking for a way to have an automatic line break. A nice GUI will come later.
Explanation text within patch:
Use [qlist] to separate text and send it to 2 different gemhead's. The textfile needs specific formatting: Bang= causes the messages to be send with times given in milisec (before destination symbol) So messages in txt file should look like this: <milliseconds> < destinationAA> <Actual display text1>;
<milliseconds> < destinationBB> <Actual display text2>;
etc. If the timing of the second message is <0> it will be send at the same time as the first message, showing up on screen at the same time.
Alternative: To use a metro for timing messages: bang first the [read textfile(, then [rewind( then [next(. BUT the timing given in txt file is ignored. Each message separated by a semicolon will get the same timing, so each time only one line of text changes. The loop back from qlist causes a repeat sending of the list after completion.
Happy projecting....

Let's explain it differently: you'll have distortion but at the same level as your input, i.e. NOT louder than what you played, as is usually the case. Well, at least, we roughly approximate to that ideal.

414,MouseState_hid,MouseState_hid,"Hi.
This is a patch for use two different mouse on pd at the same time. It's only a simple example, but worked pretty well for me. Expand it with your needs.
It works only with linux (maybe there are alternatives for OS X) because you need two programs; xinput and xdotool. You need also pd working on graphical mode with the X server.
I use [MouseState] for one mouse (the visible pointer) and [hid] for the another (not visible on screen).
Also need modify some things on the patch before run it. First exec ""xinput"" on the terminal and note the ID number of your second mouse.
Use that number and replace the ""your_ID"" included on the three xinput messages with it.
This message [xinput float your_ID( makes your second mouse stop controlling the pointer and this another [xinput reattach your_ID 2( make it works again.
Anyway, with that mouse ""hide"" [hid] continues receiving the mouse coordinates. Try it. Of course, need also search and open your device on [hid] and send [stdbuf -o0 xinput test your_ID(.
I have make this second mouse (the left side of the patch) to work like a relative rotary encoder. Also this method avoid the repeated bangs when using relative x/y on [hid].
The right side part of the patch works with [Mousestate] and the first ""visible"" Mouse. You need change the sliders properties limits with your screen ""y"" size (mine is 900, so 899). Then press ""Q"" and ""W"" for test it, xdotool makes the work here.
Why I have make something like this? Because I like control a lot of things with the less possible devices (and if they are common devices better) and make randoms, without need adjust the analog usual midi pot every time it change its value, with the imprecision involved.
How I always say, sure this can be done better, my pd skills are very limited, but maybe this patch could be useful for someone.
Ah, don't forget send [killall xinput( before close the patch for stop xinput and avoid problems.
Thanks for reading!

415,The PD Death Timer,The PD Death Timer,"This is a patch I've made to help me control my PD addiction. Run it as an abstraction in the patch that you are working on, set the timer, and then get the hell out of there before it reaches zero. Benefits include physical health, a more fast & furious patching style, more time with friends & family, etc.



Disturb mode makes a really annoying sound which you can't turn off.


Crash mode will completely crash PD. I haven't actually tested it, and I don't recommend that you do either. Take a look inside the [pd consequence] subpatch to see what I mean...


Destroy mode will completely and permanently destroy the parent patch where [death_timer] is located. This IS tested and it DOES work. If you value your work at all, it's very important that you never use this! And if you do use it then don't come crying to me when your prized patches vanish into thin air.


Russian Roulette: every minute this introduces a 1% chance that your remaining time will be halved.


I wanted to have a fourth consequence called ""uninstall PD"", but I don't think that this is possible from within PD.


It is of course possible to delete the program once it's started and carry on patching unhindered, but you'd only be cheating yourself.
Note that this is vaguely inspired by http://writeordie.com/. I hope that someone else finds it ""useful""!

I thought I would share this, because being a long time vb/vb.net programmer type of person I wanted to be able to send control data from vb.net to Pd easily.
There are various OSC libraries around, but little for Vb and nothing simple.
I was inspired by a post about pdsend i responded to the other day.
I thought surely there's a way to send data directly from vb to pd without using a batch file or cmd redirection.
I found a nifty piece of code from Kumudu Gunasekara, 27 Nov 2004 on www.codeproject.com/Articles/8877/UDP-Send-and-Receive-using-threads-in-VB-NET and modified it slightly for this execise, this allowed me to send data via a port and ip address (9001 & 127.0.0.1 (aka localhost)). At the Pd end I used mrpeach/udpreceive, but the data was ascii char values. I cant believe there isn't a conversion somewhere in Pd but I couldn't find it and made ascii.pd and cnv999.pd to resolve the problem.
There's little error checking, so I've no idea how it might interfere with other udp processes. But this is the start of a solution for me.

433,ALFATAPE 0.0.3,ALFATAPE 0.0.3,"Hi everyone!
Here is some new patch of mine:
ALFATAPE is an emulation of a simple 8-track-recorder.
It is built to use with a KORG nanoKONTROL2 controller.
You can re-assign, of course, to use with a different controller
(see README.pdf)
You have to use some midi-controller - only menu-kind-of-things are
accessible via mouse.
EDIT: As for the new version (0.1.1) this is no longer true! You now can also
use your computers keyboard to control ALFATAPE. New Link below!
The goal is simple:

no mouse-use
no visualized audio
100% destructive
good transport-behavior
easy to use

some ALFATAPE-features:

4 markers (set or go to)
choice of two loops (range or punch)
punch-in/out
recording while looping
slow rew/forward (while listening)
fast rew/forward (while listening)
bounce tracks together (in real-time)
write out audio quickly as wav (rough-mix)
latency-test
""open"", ""save as"" or ""eject"" tape
44.1k or 48k
change input of individual tracks easily
import audio to track (placing at zero)

In the main-folder you find a .png of the nanoKONTROL2 with the names of the
individual buttons/knobs/sliders (yellow) I'm referring to as for shortcuts and
midi-controlling.
You'll find a KORG nktrl2_data-file too which you can use for flashing your
nanoKONTROL for the use with ALFATAPE. In order to do so, you have to use
an application from KORG, called KORG Kontrol Editor. I used the KORG Kontrol
Editor v.1.3.0 under Linux with wine without any problems. This is not about PD,
but it's anyway a nice little peace of software: You can alter how the buttons/
knobs/sliders of your nanoKONTROL behave (momentary or toggle) and a lot
of other useful things...

The typical patch format lacks a keyboard or a good place to put one. Aside from inlets & outlets & send-tos, I'm not sure how to make a patch display short of getting into Gem...
So what I've got is basically two patches, one calling the other to keep things tidy. [Someone else might rearrange this in a simpler format?] You copy the cluster of stuff from onenum.pd; this needs ro.pd [ie ""readout""] in the path to put the number you've produced [0-129] into the number box where it displays.
To get the actual number output, you'd connect to the outlet on that box labeled 'ro'.
Useful for Midi etc?

[ro object to process that neatly off-stage, number box for display.] fits into the unused space at the lower right.

You can expand it it to control more loops plus the volume, length, speed, etc of each loop with relative ease but I'll leave that up to you.
The biggest problem is a crack or pop is audible when clearing the arrays. I just duck the sound now to avoid it but if anyone has any advice on how to keep the arrays from crackling on reset, it'd be greatly appreciated.

I spent maybe a month of constant work getting to this point; it's still a mess, but it proves the concept fairly well.
The patch itself allows the user to program 'scenes' of particles. The parameters of these scenes can then be modulated using a variety of controllers - two volume gates & two averaging modules, and four LFOs. In the patch provided, these scenes have been sequenced to form a performance of different visuals, constantly reacting to the provided piece of music.
Everything should run smoothly on patch initialisation. The sequence is specific to the track provided, but it shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to produce your own (hint - the modulation window opens from the bottom of the main window). If anyone wants a more detailed set of instructions, just ask.

447,Pythagorean Tuning wheel,Pythagorean Tuning wheel,"Hello All You, out there in PD World.
This being my #1 Post, I want to say: Thanks for having me! Here, amidst the Pure Data community. I love open source software, and the principal of sharing knowledge generally.
I only recently discovered PD--last week! I am currently on vacation from obligation, and so I am taking my time to do some intellectual callibration, and I sure do appreciate all the help, guys. already! Specifically, Maelstorm & katjav have been super helpful and enlightening. katjav: I freaking love your website (I do not understand your website, yet). But I believe vortex-based mathematics is the key to free energy and harmonics (Though, I must say: I do not know why, exactly). And DSP is so very fascinating. But I have only the most rudimentary understanding of PD, thus far. Thanks to cheetomoskeeto and his youtube page, for the very helpful video tutorials.
As my first patch, merely an adolescent, I would like to share my Pythagorean tuning wheel.
Pythagoras' tuning system, generated by whole-number ratios of perfect fifths and octaves, is more ancient than our current international standard of tuning, the ""equal temperament"" of our pianos and MIDI keyboards. And if we examine the pitches and their relationships mathematically, we find that the ancient Pythagorean system is more elegant and beautiful (e.g., the standard tuning of Middle 'C' is 261.625565 hertz, Vs. the Pythagorean 'C' @ 256 | or, standard 'D' @ 293.67, Vs. Py's 'D' @ 288. This follows, because the Py scale is *generated by pure ratios: 3/2 (the Perfect Fifth) & 2/1 (the Octave, but of course). In contradistinction, my fellows, our MIDI standard is *Tempered--the ratios are not pure. This is not merely the unfolding of some conspiratory plot. It is for very good reason, I'm sure (I just . . not sure what the reason, here is. . what IS the hold up? Why the glitch? What is this infamous comma anywho?). It is a story, unfolding.
A digital signal is a stream of numbers. Pythagoras was the father of numerology. Give this a try if you want.
Feedback is greatly appreciated.
Peace~

I am trying to build an FFT analyser so I can use it as visual feedback for an equaliser.
In order for this FFT graph to continuously average the amplitude values of each frequency, I wanted to be able to average this values as more data gets drawn in the graph.
The idea is to use a tabwrite of a certain block size, and then have several tabreads, with the block size of the initial one, divided by the number of tabreads, and then avergae the values outputted by the tabreads.
My biggest problem at the moment is to make the various tabreads read data from one value n to N/x; N being the block size, x the number of tabreads and n the value at which the previous tabread stops reading.
I have tried using [count] but it is very slow, since it depends on the metro, and I don't seem to make it work with [until] either...
Any suggestions?

453,The Polyphonic Polyrhythmer,The Polyphonic Polyrhythmer,"So the idea behind this patch is a question of what would happen if you took an ideal harmonic series, and sequenced all the partials to play in rhythmic divisions that corresponded to their 'magic' number. For example, the 3rd partial (second harmonic) will play in a rhythm of 3 to 1 to the first partial (fundamental). And then, what would it be like if there were 32 partials, and you could make the fundamental glide, and you could change the attack and decay of the partials?
I spent my last year in undergrad developing this patch into a pretty robust version and included a sequencer that could sequence everything from turning on and off the harmonics to making the generator play a melody. That version of the patch is still pretty sketchy and awkward to program, but it works, and i can share it if anyone is interested.
For now, though, here is the PR32 light. Go ahead and play around with it. Push all the buttons, and open all the pd boxes to see what's inside.

[ <--- there is a non breaking space here (ascii 160, unicode 00A0)].
When a number is required for the button text this non breaking space must precede it!. also can be used as a space.
Reqirements are:- pd-extended and s.mmb from maelstorm's mmb-master library.

477,Guitar Effects,Guitar Effects,"Hi
This zip contains various guitar effects arranged in the way I preferred
They should be easy to rewire with the blocks in the lower half
The Gui blocks in the upper half can be easily rearranged but its not necessary
The patches require:
Pd-extended
mmb-master library from maelstorm for the distortion
https://github.com/dotmmb/mmb
I've also cut & pasted compressor from patricksebastien-mtl-3ff61bb.
https://github.com/patricksebastien/mtl
The looper requires ipoke~ to be installed
http://puredata.info/Members/ipoke
There is a folder called 'Studio Presets' where i have saved some example presets
The two pitch shifters with feedback loop & envelope give a nice effect, eg. arpeggi.sps
The looper (a work in progress) has a reverse switch, but needs the speed set first then the '<' switch, then the sequence repeated when first used (haven't worked out why yet), once its running in reverse if you record at the same time then start the player below you get a reverse delay effect (R=record, C=clear, <=reverse, M= metronome F=feedback, V=volume
The speeds are set by the hradios or the hsliders.
This is my first major project, I'm having great fun with Pd
All criticism and advice welcome

479,Text from one file on different lines in GEM,Text from one file on different lines in GEM,"A patch for GEM that reads text from on file and separates it over two gemheads. The idea is to have one source textfile and to display different parts of the text on different lines at the same time or subsequently. Because it has one source file the text stays in sync.
Work in progress so any comments for improvements please. (see Pixel forum) For instance I am still looking for a way to have an automatic line break. A nice GUI will come later.
Explanation text within patch:
Use [qlist] to separate text and send it to 2 different gemhead's. The textfile needs specific formatting: Bang= causes the messages to be send with times given in milisec (before destination symbol) So messages in txt file should look like this: <milliseconds> < destinationAA> <Actual display text1>;
<milliseconds> < destinationBB> <Actual display text2>;
etc. If the timing of the second message is <0> it will be send at the same time as the first message, showing up on screen at the same time.
Alternative: To use a metro for timing messages: bang first the [read textfile(, then [rewind( then [next(. BUT the timing given in txt file is ignored. Each message separated by a semicolon will get the same timing, so each time only one line of text changes. The loop back from qlist causes a repeat sending of the list after completion.
Happy projecting....

I'm preparing now a new Patch for my new Composition for ensemble and live electronics (min 9 Microphones for 9 instruments)

Do I have to use an audio interface with more than 9 inputs or I'm able to use the soundflower patch to send the inputs trough 2 inputs
I feel like I'm not clear enough
I have an Audio Interface (Roland Firewire Fa 66) and I have main 2 inputs and an other 4 inputs but I don't like to use them, is it possible to use Multichannel mixer to get the signal from the instruments and to send them to my 2 main Channels on my audio interface, then to send this signal to the soundflower patch to separate them to 9 input Channels or I'm crazy to think in this way??
hope that any one can understand me and giving me some advices because I don't know how to tack 9 individual Instruments to send them to my patch and to control them

Pros:
pretty abstract, one subpatch with LED-ID (midi note) as parameter makes global changes to colors really easy, can disable single rows with ""play"" buttons to the right, can be included as subpatch
Cons:
Lots of global receives and sends (all starting with ""lp_"")

it lets you increase the volume of an audio stream without getting nasty digital clipping and buzzing. ..of course sometimes you do want that sound, but more often than not it will add nasty frequencies to your sounds when you push their volume up too high.
you can use it in any situation where you you normally use [clip~ -1 1] ... or the way i prefer to think about it is that you can use it in any situation where a hardware device has an audio output.
so, if you make a synth running through an effect to a mixer, then you would use the tanh function at the outlet of the synth audio stream, then another one at the outlet of the fx stream, and then again at the outlet of the mixer.
the simplest way to do it is this:
[inlet~]

[expr~ tanh($v1)]

[outlet~]
but [expr~ ] kills your cpu, so it's better to put the function into a table, and then just read the table with [tabread~]

Have been messing about with Pd off and on for a little bit. Actually, haven't recently been using it, but I know it will make it's cycle again.
Last time I delved into it I grasped much more than any time before, and to learn I decided to make a drum machine.
Somewhere I had seen a tip along the lines of ""If you don't have a clear goal in mind, you can get lost in all the options within Pd"". That's the main reason I decided to focus on a single goal and learn how to get there.
I should point out a few things:
-The sound generation leaves a LOT to be desired, that wasn't my focus, although hopefully I will someday improve this part (or you could drop AFs Simple Drums in there...great HH generator!).
-I'm most proud of the step sequencer. I'm open to critiques about it, and it could probably be done more neatly, but as my first true patch I'm quite happy with it.
-It won't live up to it's name at this point (Pd808), but I think that's a funny pun!
-I'm posting this to share it, as well as archive it.
-I can't remember if I used any specific Extended objects, but that's what I run with, so it's highly possible.

The typical patch format lacks a keyboard or a good place to put one. Aside from inlets & outlets & send-tos, I'm not sure how to make a patch display short of getting into Gem...
So what I've got is basically two patches, one calling the other to keep things tidy. [Someone else might rearrange this in a simpler format?] You copy the cluster of stuff from onenum.pd; this needs ro.pd [ie ""readout""] in the path to put the number you've produced [0-129] into the number box where it displays.
To get the actual number output, you'd connect to the outlet on that box labeled 'ro'.
Useful for Midi etc?
[one row horizontal radio box, size 13, X10 to handle 0-120 ] plus [next row is a size 10 radio box to provide the ones digit.]
[ro object to process that neatly off-stage, number box for display.] fits into the unused space at the lower right.

So I tried to imitate zexy's [list2symbol] with vanilla objects today, and I could similarly get it working.
My abstraction takes a list and replaces space between items in a list with 'hyphen(-)' to change the list to a symbol.
e.g) a list ""a b c 1 2 3"" changes to a symbol ""a-b-c-1-2-3""
a list should consist of maximum 6 items(5 spaces), and the rest will be ignored.
And if it takes a single float from it's inlet, the result remains the same.
e.g) a single float ""123"" will remain a float ""123""

I have made a clonewheel organ. I have based my design as far as possible on information I found on the internet.

But, it doesnt really compare with the real thing, even though I never had the pleasure to laid my hands on one.
Any suggestions on improvements are very welcome!
Things included in my simulation:

tonewheel frequencies rather than the normal note frequencies
percussion effect
keyclick (I do think its very good though)
vibrato and chorus scanner (found very little info on this - and it sucks!)
rotary speaker emulation
ability to store 4 presets

Things I know it is lacking:

tonewheel waveform is simplified to a sinewave
crosstalk (have not found any good info on this)

I have made a input controller that fit my midi-gear to get quick access to the drawbars, presets, overdrive and the leslie. I could recommend anyone that want to use it to make such a thing themselves. Use the command inlet for each abstraction to control it.
It should work with pd-extended.

Admittedly I don't know quite as much as I'd like to about granular synthesis, but I've seen a few implementations and I've taken the idea of playing back short bits of a sample in overlapping grains and applied that to a 5-voiced delay patch.
Each of the 5 voices randomly plays back snippets from the last 20 seconds of adc~ input, using different envelopes and randomization patterns. I've tried to give each of them a distinct sonic identity based on their location, length, attack and decay, frequency and volume. One of them will play back at a random pitch as well.

edit: new, more accurate Buchla ""Arbitrary Function Generator"" abstraction; the inside is the messiest thing I've ever seen in Pd though.
inlets: #1: start, stop (1/ 0)
#2: Randomize on/off (1/ 0)
#3: Step offset (0 - 15)
#4: all steps output on/off (1/ 0)
#5: Fill 1st Bank of outputs (any float)
#6: Fill 2nd bank
#7: Fill 3rd bank
#8: Number of steps (1 - 16)
#9: Fill and sync bank 3 with tempo on/off (1/ 0)
#10: tempo (20 - any float), in ms
#11: All steps always nested loops on/off (1/ 0)
Outlets: 1st 16: 1st bank of floats 2nd 16: 2nd bank 3rd 16: 3rd bank
The way the nested loops work: the top left number box shows the next repeat to take place. the number box on the bottom left controls how many times to jump to the specified step, the bottom right number box controls which step to specify, the toggle on the upper right turns ""always"" mode on and off. When always mode is on, the step always jumps to the destination step, whereas if it is off, it will jump to the destination step as many times as specified in the bottom left number box.
When offset is used with nesting, it will jump to the offset# + the specified step, but it will still jump from the un-offsetted (?) step. Randomize doesn't work with nesting either.
The real thing can also quantize and interpolate, but that should be easy to do with line after the outputs.

507,7-Band Parametric EQ,7-Band Parametric EQ,"Hello,
I'm really new to PureData and especially new to this community and forum (I just registered), but I saw some people talking earlier about trouble with making a parametric equalizer, and I think I may have found something. I don't know if this is the most efficient or logical way of doing it, but it is powerful and effective. The noise~ object can be replaced with either an adc~ object or a preloaded sample, and the same sort of effect results. The ""Resonance"" sliders do not actually act as attenuation faders, though they do increase the resonance of the notch filter around a specified center frequency. They are incredibly sensitive, as their range is rather large, but I thought it'd be better to have an excessive range, as it is now possible to filter out an entire signal's frequency spectrum.
The metro object for writing to the tables and the according toggle switch are in the sub patch, ""pd time.""
Any help, criticism, etc. would be greatly appreciated. This is my first attempt at any frequency-specific modulation and I had this idea and it is audibly effective; I just feel like there are multiple ways to achieve this goal.
Also! Regarding another issue I have. Can anyone explain how to take a snapshot of an audio instant as a function of frequency over time, rather than amplitude over time? If I knew how to do this, I would feel way more confident that this EQ is doing what I want it to, and not just creating a similar sounding effect.

This is my first post! Whey. I figured I'd upload a patch I've been expanding over the last few weeks. I work mainly on a Macbook so there may be problems running it on windows/linux - I wouldn't know. Apologies if this is the case! The simplest way to understand how to operate it is to ask - If you can't work out what you're supposed to be doing just write a reply on here and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
Oh and also - the only reason it's called the 'Beautiful version' is because I've decorated it with Canvas' etc. It's not an arrogant statement at all haha.

513,PD Synth - User Feedback Request.,PD Synth - User Feedback Request.,"Hi all,
Heres a synth I've put together using many different sources. I created this as part of a uni project. It still needs a lot of work on it, and is quite messy in some places.
As it is, I would like some user feedback. Would you be kind enough to have a play with it for 5mins and provide me with some feedback.
About the synth:
Oscillators - each Osc has four saw waves each with a pitch decrepancy of 2.5 cents to cause a slight phasing, each voice is fixed at a different postion within the stereo field.
Envelope - standard ADSR, still has problems: the release is being triggered every time it receives a velocity of 0, so when playing in a legato fashion it can cause glitches or stuttering.
State Variable Filter - uses [svf~]. Toggle selection of filters enable you to layer several different types. Also uses an LFO to modulate signal. LFO Stereo Offset adds a delay of up to 1.5 seconds to the right outlet.
Modulated Band Pass Filter - uses [bp~]. also uses [random] and [metro] to modulate the frequency cutoff.
Sub Bass Oscillator - This is meant to be a sub harmonic synthesiser. For the purposes of a prototype, this is outputting a two sine waves, one fixed at 55hz the other controlled by user input.
Velocity Controlled Filter - a low pass filter controlled by velocity to differentiate between soft and hard notes.
Feedback:
Please can you consider the following points:
Your initial thoughts, ergonomics and user ability, layout of the GUI and quality of the sound outputted.
Would you find it a useful tool in your compostions?
What would you like to see improved in the future?
Future Developments:
Here are a few ideas I would like to implement in future development.
Saving Presets -
Currently a user has to note down any settings and manually recall them; this can be inaccurate and prone to human error. An ideal solution would be to have a feature where users could save their presets of sounds created and digitally recall them.
Portamento-
This would give the user control over the amount of time in which note pitches, crossover or glide between each other.
Pitch discrepancy
Another idea to give voices further separation would be to constantly modulate the pitch discrepancy within a very small and limited range. This would be governed by a slow oscillating sine wave. Experiments would have to be carried out to find if a single oscillator, modulating all the voices pitch discrepancies in order to keep all the voices synchronised. Would this be the best option or would it be better to have separate non synchronised oscillators at various speeds?
Routing Matrix-
This would be an easy-to-use interface as part of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enable the user to choose in what order the signal path flows to each module, also giving options to run signal paths through modules in series or in parallel.
Frequency Crossover-
Primarily this module would give the user choice of several variable frequency bands and their type of output, ie; mono or stereo. An interesting feature to add would be to tie this into the proposed routing matrix module to allow the routing of different frequency bands to different destinations. This would be useful in routing different frequencies bands to certain effect modules.
Stereo widening-
This would place the sound by varying degrees into the negative phase to simulate a widening of the sound within the stereo field. The user would control the amount via a slider or rotary in the GUI. This would be connected to or use features from the proposed frequency crossover module to control which band of frequencies were affected, ie; it would be useful to keep the sub bass frequencies in mono and only widen the mid and high frequencies.
Equalisation-
This module would be a five band equaliser featuring a High Pass and Low Pass filter along with three variable bell equalisers. It would also be useful to tie this in with the proposed Routing Matrix so that the user could insert this into different destinations within the signal path.
Effects
There is a long list of useful effects that could be implemented into this project, including: Reverb, Delay with tempo sync options, Unison, and Bit Crusher. All would be separate modules and would give the user several parameters to control the effected signal.
Creative Waveforms.
This uses arrays to allow the user to draw in different shapes as waveforms for each main oscillator. This feature would give the user an extra layer of creative freedom, however it could cause problems so would have to include some preset waveforms for the user to initialise, such as sine, square and sawtooth waves. This would also make an interesting addition as a means of controlling the LFO oscillation.
The project is attached below. Please note: the Synthgui.pd file is the main window.
Greatly appreciated, Student Sound Designer.

I made this to be congruent with the keyboard-note-input behavior in Renoise, Z = C-4, Q = C-5. If you are looking at the patch, the bangs on the top correspond to your lower half keys starting with C-4, and the bangs on the bottom correspond with your upper half keys starting with C-5. Use this with midi yoke to forward the midi messages to your DAW.
I was looking for a patch like this, which I thought would be pretty easy to find, but I had trouble finding it, so I just had to implement it myself. I hope this is useful to you. Comments are very welcome! Please post a reply!! if (a) there's another patch with the same functionality that predates mine which I was just unable to find, or (b) you think ""this is really sweet and wow why didn't anybody do this before?"" or (c) you modify the patch or its structure is useful for your patch which implements an isomorphic keyboard layout.

518,Guitar Synth - honors bendin & pbr - works with slide & whammy bar!,Guitar Synth - honors bendin & pbr - works with slide & whammy bar!,"As my first project to learn pd, I chose to write a very simple guitar synth, that will take 6 discreet channels of MIDI input, including pitch bend information, and play a simple sawtooth sound. 6 discreet channels is important to capture the full guitar performance, because that's exactly what a guitar is...
***Thus, to REALLY play this patch, you need a 6-channel instrument that generates MIDI output... E.g., a guitar with a Fishman TriplePlay pickup or the MIDI output from a guitar with a Roland GK3 driving a Roland VG unit or similar. ***
Your PBR (pitch bend range) and your starting channel are configurable, and must agree with your transmitting midi guitar controller.
This patch is actually quite fun to fool around with. With a pitch bend range of 12 or 24, you can run a slide all up & down the neck and it works perfectly!
Three files attached:

sjrbPDGS1.pd - the guitar synth main program
SynthModule-saw-1.pd - an abstraction used for each of the 6 channels
Bendin-mtof-freq-calc-expr.pd - This is basically a 'help' file to explain the formula & let you test it. It is not needed to run the synth.

Frequency calculation, using notein and bendin:
I had a VERY hard time finding how to actually honor pitch bends in pd. Lots of folks have asked the question out there on the web, only to receive kinda useless theoretical answers. It took me a while to work out the formula:
[expr $f2*pow(2, (($f3*($f1-8192))/98304))]
Where:
$f1 = bendin value
$f2 = mtof value from midi note from notein
$f3 = pbr, pitch bend range
Formula explained:
freq-w-pb = freq * 2^((pbr/12)*((bendin-8192)/8192))
Which simplifies to:
freq-w-pb = freq * 2^((pbr*(bendin-8192))/98304)
Note similarity to:
next-note-freq = freq * 2^(1/12)
I.e., it's all about powers of 2... In increments of 1/12ths, it's your semitones. But when applying pitchbend, you don't want increments of semitones, you want increments of 1/8192ths of pbr # of semitones.
Bendin values range from 0-16383, where:
0 = bend the note DOWN by pbr# of semitones
8192 = NO bend
16384 = bend the note UP by pbr# of semitones
Yes, I know there is a one-off error (max is 16383, not 16384), and you can't actually get all the way to 16384, but it's so close nobody will ever hear the difference...
I hope this makes sense!
Caveats:
Pitchbend is a 14-bit value, requiring TWO bytes of data from your MIDI controller, one with MSB and one with LSB. Some gear only sends MSB (0-63=down and 64-127=up). The good news is that bendin properly reports it in the 0-16383 range, so no special coding is needed. However, the bend will NOT sound smooth, there will be audible steps, especially when using high PBR values. You'd need to modify this algorithm with a [line~] somewhere to even out the steps. Or stick to low PBR values when using very old gear.
Feedback welcome! I've just started learning...

I've been having a little play around today trying to make a patch that will run through a circle of fifths.
I started making it for a project I'm working on where I want an endless play through of many different scales and octaves.
The patch will randomly play notes from the scale of Cmajor, when it plays the fifth for a fourth time it will then move on to the Gmajor scale and play notes from it randomly; then when it plays the fifth of the G scale four times it will move on to the Dmajor scale; and so on.
There's also a randomizer that will shift notes up or down an octave every now and then too.
I thought this may be helpful to someone somewhere for some reason sometime so I've decided to share the wealth

for my live setup - we are using a macbook anyway so its ok to have PD running - i am routing the Behringer FCB1010 Footpedal to various things. I was following the mailinglist on the FCP1010 for a while but these custom eproms people there are using still looked kind of unflexible to me - not to speak about the internal programming feature of the foot pedal, which is a (complicated) joke.
So i decided to make a PD patch which can route:

Signals to multiple Midi-Outs
Expression Pedals to any Parameter
Use footswitches as either on-off toggles, one-shot trigger or patch changer

i left the FCB1010 in default programm, sending its output exclusively to PD, transforming the data to which i want to and then use internal Midi Routing via IAC (on the mac) to send it to software or routing it to other midi out, a Line6 Pocketpod in my case.
Its my first patch so it is kind of horrible probably (but working for my purpose), so i wanted to ask for suggestions what i could optimize.
maybe if some of you can spare a minute to check it out, that would be great.
btw. i receive midi with my M-audio FW410 from the FCB1010, sending it to Live internally and Line6 Pocketpod connected via USB.

I'd like to share ""Tuner"", which, as the subject says, is a two-panels, crossfading, enveloping sampler patch.
Nothing really new nor awesome, just a PureFun(TM) project ...
Here's a screenshot:



Requirements:
Grid from ""Unauthorized"" library (Pd Extended it's fine)


How to play:
on startup the patch loads four+four default samples. Activate the start/stop dsp button
and start moving the ""TUNER"" control in the center of the patch. This gives
more weight to each of the four samples. With the control in the middle all samples
are mixed together. If you move the second slider on the right the second set of samples
are activated now. Simple, isn't it?


There is the possibility to manually load a set of four samples, and you can do it
while the other panel is active (if the samples are not too heavy).
For example, if the left panel is active load 4 sample
on the right panel (and don't forget to resynch after loading if needed!).

542,Looper-Effect KP3 style,Looper-Effect KP3 style,"ATENTION: this is some kind of effect, NOT A LOOPER.
This effect emulates the looper effect from the KP3 (Kaoss Pad 3 multi-effect sampler). What does it do? You send signal and, when you press one of the 8 boxes of the HRadio, it start looping in 4, 2, 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 and 1/32 beats. You can change to any box at any time. To stop, press stop (in KP3, you touch the pad horizontally and it stops when you release the finger. That's the idea to being used with a Tablet, for example). Try it.
How does it work?
When the effect is ""activated"", it starts recording in a 8 seconds table (A). When it reach second 4, it starts recording in a second 8 seconds table (B). If you press a box in the first 8 seconds, it uses table A. If you press after second 8, it uses B. In this way, it always has 4 safe seconds of recording (it is only an effect, it will never uses more than 4 seconds of loop).
When you click any box, it calculate and start doing 8 ~vline loops at the same time. And, depend of how many beats you want to loop, it sends the signal to the table (A or  to play it. When you click STOP, it stops playing and starts recoding again. It's equal to the KP3 effect (KP3 looper effects adds some effects at the same time in vertical movement, like LPF, HPF, Flanger, Decimator, etc: TO-DO).
DOWNLOAD IT AND TRY IT! Open ""todos_fx.pd"" (it works with the adc~).
Now, if anyone tried and like it... feel free to use it! And if anyone can make an improvement to it, post it here! About CPU consumption, for example. I don't know about it.

548,1D Cellular Automata to MIDI patch,1D Cellular Automata to MIDI patch,"If you have any interest in cellular automata, please check this out. . .
This started out as an attempt to hear some of the patterns that I was looking at in pictures of 1D cellular automata, or perhaps just to see what it would be like coding them in PD. Basically, an array (of variable size) of 1s or 0s updates according to the CA rules at the top (I followed Wolfram's convention for naming the rules.) There is another array (of up to 25 cells) which I call the 'audible window', which is a subset of the main array and is mapped to midi notes; the audible window can be moved around within the main array.
I started mostly just as a proof of concept thing, but I realized a few (admittedly self-evident) details pretty quickly:

that deterministically random rules sound well . . . random
that most rules involving potentially interesting phenomena like nesting and complexity are interesting primarily in a global, bird's eye view sense; within my local-only audible window approach there is not so much intersting action (there are exceptions, like rule 150, where the nesting shows itself along the centre of the array)
that using my approach, localized phenomena will be more of more musical use (at least from my limited aesthetic point of view) - and that there really is some potentially fruitful musical material to be found in these local structures

So, I played around. Many rules will display interesting periodic patterns if a small toroidal array is used (e.g., given any random initial condition, rule 110 always seems to fall into a period of 7 with an 11 cell toroidal array).
The most musically interesting discovery for me was with rule 73/109. Given (nearly) any random initial condition, in an array of any size, it will very quickly settle into a multitude of independent localized structures, each with its own period. The most common periods are 2 or 3 steps, but longer periods are quite common, and really long ones not at all rare. By moving the audible window around within the main array you can straddle multiple structures with different periods creating some real interesting polymeter. By moving the window one step at a time, the resultant rhythms feel like they are developing. Mapping the midi notes to percussion sounds also creates some fascinating beats. (bang 'reset_and_start' in the 'random_up' subpatch for a demo - it will gradually shift the audible window up thru a randomly seeded array)

This is my first post, and my first patch.
It generates a nice electronic funk/jazz/acid song out of a chord sequence.
There's a drum, a bass-line, a ""rhythm-guitar"", a pad, two nasty and one sweet melody.
To hear it, turn on the volume of each part and the master, and hit the green square.
It is based on a patch I made on my NordModular 10 years ago, and that I reworked recently.
You need pd-exended and Maelstorm's state saving abstractions:
http://puredata.hurleur.com/sujet-5664-state-saving-abstractions
I used obiwannabe's fairly efficient analog drums as one layer of the kick and snare, and took sumidero's keymetro as a timekeeper. These are incorporated as sub-patches so you don't need to download them separately. Here's the addresses for attribution's sake:
http://puredata.hurleur.com/sujet-1093-fairly-efficient-analog-drums
http://puredata.hurleur.com/sujet-5470-metronome-bangs-bar-main-subdivision-others
I also used a modified version Miller's phaser effect from the doc's
This is quite a CPU-heavy patch, but you could use less oversampling if your PC isn't fast enough.
I didn't really sanitize it, so all my beginner mistakes are in there, and it looks horrible.
It does sound quite cool if I may say so myself 
*************************************************************************************
A simplified rundown of how it works:
*************************************************************************************
***** choosing notes*****************************************************************************************
All melody instruments randomly choose notes from a scale that gets transposed up and down according to a predefined 16 bar scheme.
The bass and L+R melody's use a markov-chain to decide which note to play, where the likelyness of each note is defined with the GUI. The octave get's switched around as well, and if the final note is too low to sound good, it is transposed up an octave.
The bass decides when to glide based on which note within the chord it is playing and to which it is going, so disregarding the octave and the chord-scheme transposes
The LR melody's decide when to glide based on the difference between the current and the next note, including actave and transposes. (that's why they have these nice long down-slides)
The ""rhythm-guitar"" always plays 3 notes left and 3 right, of which one on each side is randomly chosen out of 4 possible combinations, in such a way that they always form a balanced LR picture.
The pad plays a full triad on each side, but with a random octave chosen each bar. It start gliding to these notes half a bar before the chord change, and arrives at the chord change.
The lead chooses it's notes and octave fully random, but with a preference for the root .
It has two ""modes"": it either plays long legato notes with slow glides, in which case it stays within the current octave, or plays quicker phrases with a faster glide.
It also features a slowly in fading vibrato on long notes.
*****Making rhythms*****************************************************************************************
The drums feature a kick on every 1 and 3 and a snare on 2 and 4. Then a low-passed noise generator decides where and how loud the other kicks and snares are: positive for snares, negative for kicks, quantized to 16th notes.
The HH is a 1 bar loop, but by modulating it with the total output level, you get interesting, and somehow appropriate HH patterns.
The bass gets it's rhythm from a 16 step sequencer, whit 3 fades for each step:
The first governs the likeliness of whether to change the volume at all from the last step.
The second has the minimum volume, and the third set's the maximum of a random number that gets added to it.
Then the level of the kick gets subtracted from this, so that notes that where loud get punched in a bit by the kick, and if there where no notes at that point, they get created.
The attack and decay also get modulated.
The LR melody's base their rhythms on the difference between the current and the next note, and on the difference between the left and the right note.
Their level gets modulated by the snare level in a similar way as the bass.
The ""rhythm-guitar"" always plays the same sequence rhythm-wise.
The pad slowly comes in when the other instruments are silent for a moment, but also slightly random.
The lead has a random rhythm with random longer brakes. It also has a tendency to turn of on the less harmonic note of the bunch, so it stays nice and sweet sounding.
****** getting tones *****************************************************************************************
And finaly some notes on the synths used:
The tones of the bass and LR melody's follow the same ""random rhythmic lfo generator"" in such a way that when the bass is bright the melody's are mellow, and vice versa.
The bass, LR, guitar and lead are all FM synths with internal and external tanh distortion and some internal and external lop and hip filtering.
The lead is differently modulated left and right, for width.
The pad is band passed phasors put trough a phaser effect.
The kick has two layers, obiwannabe kick for punch and a swept down sine for weight.
The sine's decay is fast when there's bass playing, and slow when not, to maximise heaviness without being in the way of the bass.
The snare has 5 different layers:
-obiwannabe's snare
-a filtered pulse for extra crack
-some sines for weight
-some sines with noise FM, different for left and right for width
-filtered noise, again different for left and right for width
Might seems overkill, but the snare sounds a lot worse when you turn of a layer 
*************************************************************************************
There's a lot more going on in this patch but since this already turned in to a full essay I'll stop here.
I'm more than willing to try and answer any questions you may have though.
Have fun with it, and I'd love to hear any modifications you come up with.
All the best,
Bart.

557,Multi-track playback,Multi-track playback,"Hi,
I recently made a patch in order to playback large audio files on performance (about 20-30 min), with some basic features (looping points), reverse playback & changing speed and 16-band equalization.
Main idea of this patch is to have a nice and handy GUI (performances are made with a friend that don't want to learn how to code).
This is a combination of :

loading file with [readsf~] in a oversampling [block~] subpatch
Miller's patch ""B16.long-varispeed"" over multiple tables
homemade multislider based on [gcanvas]
a basic mixer

I would be happy to get some commentaries about it, bug report, ideas for improvements.
I also have a bug that occurs on windows vista but apparently not on mac os. When all of the four players already have a sample loaded, trying to ""openpanel"" a new file will freeze all DSP after about 5 seconds. Closing the openpanel window will make the DSP restart normally. I don't think this is about CPU overload (average CPU usage is 15% on my laptop running windows vista).
Looked through the forum and found no clue, but some people report the same problem :

Or get an idea if there's even any point to this in pd and if it is worth documenting it and maintaining it for the public.
the patch offers ten layers of granular/spectral soundfile or live input processing. there's 100 preset slots that can be accessed from within each layer and morphed between. full osc/midi control is possible. a pd port of the great polygome monome-patch is included. you can also load instrument banks, and play them as oneshots or using the sample slicing engine (just name each sample by it's corresponding midi pitch and choose the folder the samples are contained in). there's lfos and one assignable multi parameter for each layer. all settings and samples are stored in the presets to make it a fast and intuitive live instrument, that was my priority. it harmonizes perfectly with korg nano kontrol.
so far it was made and tested by me only in pd-ext 42.5 on osx. in addition only the soundhack externals are needed to get the decimator to work. loading might take up to 3 minutes or more! that is normal for now, but i hope i can do something about it in the future.

It's also possible save and Load up to 100 Presets, which are saved in Text-files, so you can share and show to me or to others or to your grandparents if you want .
Please give me a little note in the stuff, where could i make the Influence better and what do you think could i do to fix the crappy looking at the multiply-voice-part.
Have fun,

When you hit the start button, the lights should flash and then 'YES' will appear on the LCD. From there you can test the buttons, the LED light commands, the LCD commands, etc. All of the subpatches are just samples of how to use the data, rip them apart to make your own abstractions.
Technical Details:
Make sure your padkontrol is connected to PD using JACK or patchage to manage midi connections.
The initialize command sets up the midi channel on 10 (which is the default when it's out of native mode as well)
In native mode the pads will output 1 thru 16 on midi channel 10 AND output sysex messages too, both ways are shown in the patch.
The x-y pad is accessed through CC 16 and 17, again on midi channel 10
I put a bunch of comments in the patch, but if your stuck or have questions I'll do my best to help.

577,Patch for controlling hardware sampler pitch bend values,Patch for controlling hardware sampler pitch bend values,"Honestly, I think it would be an extreme coincidence if anyone had an immediate use for this patch but I wanted to post it anyway in case there was some component you wanted to take out of it and use.
Briefly this patch uses the ctrlins55-95 to attach pitch bend values to incoming MIDI notes 35-98.
The problem I was trying to solve with this is that I have a sampled phrases chopped up into 14 or so slices, and I want to be able to pitch them all differently on the fly. This would have taken 350 dedicated pads! (14slices x 25 pitchs in a 3 octave span). So this pretty much gives me a pitch knob per pad.
Also if you do make use of this remember to separate each instrument to a different midi channel to keep the bend ranges from getting mixed up

579,Modulare,Modulare,"~moduLaRe~ is mainly a personal tool for processing live flute sound in a creative way, but at the end it became something interesting that I think is worth sharing. The tool is based on work done by other people, in particular on a patch by Stephen Christopher Stamper (and other people that kindly shared their work, please see the acknowledgements in the user manual). I&#8217;m mostly interested to the flute, but in principle it should work with any input provided. ~moduLaRe~ is conceived as a &#8220;live performance&#8221; tool: my set-up is composed by a laptop, a midi keyboard, a microphone and a Korg NanoKontrol. The NanoKontrol allows the player to interact with the instrument easily and minimizes the use of mouse, giving much more freedom when interacting with a musical instrument. The computer keyboard is used for controlling the patch parameters as well. The user has 4 possible inputs/controls: pc keyboard, MIDI keyboard, Korg NanoKontrol and microphone. Controllers are connected on the audio board and to the PC. Note that even without the Nanocontrol and midi keyboard still microphone and pc keyboard provide useful inputs. The following is the ~moduLaRe~ user interface:

You can get modulare here (v 0.11 - small bug fix).
Have a look at the manual first (it is included in the download archive).
Feedback, improvements, suggestions are welcome. If you find any bug please post it here.
Tested on pd 0.42.5 extended (on Windows)
Modulare is a PureFun(C) project.

I'm new to the forum and pd in general and would like to share my first finished patch.

Of course the pad-, fader- and knob- movement is also implemented.
I suppose this patch will only work in linux since sysex over [midiout] is buggy in windows and i don't have a mac to test it.
The patch should be pretty self-explaining although its not the tiedest. I'm sure many things could be done more elegantly and i'm open for feedback on that matter.

What i want to do?
I want to make a patch, a sample player. When i press a button i want to loop the actual sample position according to the key i have pressed.
I give you an example. I load a loop which is 120 BPM fast. I set somewhere my tempo. When i press ""a"" it starts looping 1/4th at the actual play position.
For this sort of thing. The Sample Player seems to be perfect. But now there are the difficulties.
How can i set the tempo right? I figured out how to calculate the tempo for any note length.
How can i get my keyboard entries into the software?

594,Random Sample Chopper,Random Sample Chopper,"I hope this is all in order, this is my first post to this forum. Let me know if I should do anything differently.
Here's a patch which chops a loop into slices and plays them in a random order. The slice sizes are musically useful divisions also chosen at random. The speed of playback can be scaled as well with the speed slider. Turning off ""vary scaler"" locks the division size, but not the note length. Turning off ""vary note length"" locks the current note length, resulting in playback at different speeds for each division. The ""jump to slice function"" jumps directly to the new sample slice start when active. When deactivated, the playback counter slides towards the sample end. This results in reverse playback and sample speed changes.
You can see it in action here:

The hardest part of the patch was getting the ""jump to slice start"" functionality to work. The ""trigger bang bang"" object ensures the jump to start happens before the sample starts playing.
Download the patch here:
https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3_LeP1jqO1mWFVvTzRKbmh3N28

I have been working with the following patch to detect the frequency of beating interaction between adjacent strings on my guitar. The dream is to extract this instrumental 'figurative gesture' and assign it to a low frequency oscillation in real-time.
At this point, I am looking for suggestions on how to improve this process and make it performance-ready. Comparing sine wave-based oscillators with a guitar string is like comparing apples and oranges, so I was hoping some of you that have a guitar handy might test it out and make some suggestions.
Edit - For example; I have a simple expression in place in an attempt to provide a frequency threshold between a tracked frequency and the computation of instantaneous amplitudes implemented by Katja. It has been suggested that this may be better suited to MIDI notes instead of frequencies.
The patch is based on Katja's [helmholtz~] object: http://puredata.hurleur.com/sujet-6776-helmholtz-guess

this is my first post here --- been working on this drone / noise synth for an upcoming digital art show of sorts. the idea is that the synth requires little to no interaction from the audience (most importantly: no learning curve) and outputs an ever-changing autonomous composition.
the front panel doesn't offer any input controls at the moment (the [output~] can be found in the subpatch] -- just some bangs as indicator lights and a vu meter for show. for the next version i am planning pulling a grid of unlabeled toggles up to the front so the user can click some boxes and turn the evolving parts on and off -- adding a human element to the randomness. the sliders for [freeverb~] may eventually end up on the front too.
also I want to pull the volume control out to the front and have a switch for the dsp on/off (these may be the only labeled parts). i am still trying to figure this out.... if there is a link you can share on pointing me toward some front interface design methods (how do you hide all wires, etc?) i'd really appreciate it.

admittedly this isn't as sophisticated as a most of the great work here, but I like how this thing sounds -- if you give it some time it may surprise you.

Some basic instructions: (I should write a readme for it)
1. Load a video or two using the appropriate buttons. (.mov)
2. Load a song, or not. A song that is beat oriented looks best in my opinion. (.wav) Wait for it to load in the array below.
3. Select whether you are using one or two videos.
4. Adjust the volume sliders for the videos and music.
5. Press 'Play' to start the music and video. (X11 opens here for me for the video, I imagine this will vary on another OS)
6. Tap the spacebar in time to the music to set the tempo for the remixer. The tempo is visible at the top left.
7. Once you have the tempo set as you want it press 'Remix'.
8. The video will remix itself to the music.
Adjust the VideoFX Sensitivity to have the flashes occur more frequently. Adjust Reverse Playback to set how often the video plays backwards.
Also you can press 'Record A/V' to save the playback to a .mov file that should appear in the HD directory.
The remix is all random which limits how effective the cuts can be but it is also very satisfying when something ends up syncing perfectly in an unexpected way. I had considered making the user be able to scrub the video to choose points in the timeline to jump to specifically to allow more control over the cuts but I decided it wasn't what I was going for. I may do another version that enables this but I'm leaving it out of this one.
That's about all there is to it. I'm interested in any kind of feedback. One thing I haven't been able to figure out is how to stop the remixer function along with everything else. It's not a big deal but if anyone has ideas please let me know.
Thank you.

614,Simple Preset Manager,Simple Preset Manager,"Made a simple preset manager with a graphical interface, thought it might be useful to someone. Basically takes in up to 20 numbers and stores them in a text document, which can be called upon at any time. The y range on the array can be changed to better suit the values you are using. As of now it is set for numbers between -100 and 100, so anything out of that range will stretch outside of the array but will still work.
Just change the read & write locations to a location on your computer and everything should work fine.

621,Sprung Joystick Utility,Sprung Joystick Utility,"Hello,
this is just a small patch for when I use a gaming joystick with a spring. Often it would be better to be able to increment or decrement a value by pushing the joystick up or down but then leave the value where it is as the joystick springs back to the middle rather than have the value go back also. So this patch only counts up from the centre position and down from the centre position. It does not count as the joystick moves back to the middle.
Just change the value in the split object to whatever the middle of your joystick range is - it could be 127 or 32'000 or .
It is not a hard patch but I found it finicky to build and it works well enough for me. It might be of some use to others.

622,EWOCvj videomixer.,EWOCvj videomixer.,"EWOCprojects proudly presents the all new and fully-featured Pure Data video mixer application called EWOCvj.
The application is quite a beast to set up, requiring a Linux setup, installation of Pd-extended and compilation of some custom Pd externals. EWOCvj is under continual development but can be used and is already used for variable VJ tasks. To use the program one needs one or two quadcore computers (PAL 25f 720x576 output) or dual core (15f 320x240 - not yet supported) and the application is specifically written to be used with the Vestax VCI-100 MIDI mixing'n'scratching deck, you won't be able to use it without one, maybe future will see a mouse-only interface? When using two computers, one can VJ with two persons, the video database being on both machines, with one preparing videos with loop and effect settings and sending all this data to the other machine, where the other person performs the live mix. EWOCvj features 46 realtime video effects with 5 effects per deck (two decks A and  and per-deck saturation settings, 10 video wipes, a normal and inverse chroma key, one video+effect monitor per deck, Quicktime recording of monitors or mix, 32 video bank in 4 saveable 8 video parts, 8 videos in preset bank for direct triggering with Korg NANOpad2 and another NANOpad2 serves as loop input recorder/player. Videos and parts can be sent to other locations on the same or other machine. Most effects have a parameter, controlled by a turning knob. The video database consists of Quicktime movies 720x576 25f and one needs to transcode to the dv codec.
We know this program needs a load of setup and hardware, thats why we would really like to know if anyone is using it on any projects, also feedback and feature requests are always welcome. Also arrangements can be made if help is wanted getting the setup together. Consider this program ""feedback-ware"", if you use it, let us know at paleajed@gmail.com!

623,Audio analysis for QLC,Audio analysis for QLC,"Hi,
I've tried to make a patch to detect audio tempo and convert it to a midi cc value that is sent to Qlight controller midi input.
Qlight controller is a great software for lightings, but it lacks audio-to-light features yet. But as it's possible to send midi values to control sliders (those sliders can be assigned to different kinds of parameters, here I use it to control the timing of a chaser, with min. value 0sec and max value 1second)
Here the result of my experiences: 4 different versions of audio analysis, + 1 with fix BPM value using a bpm2msec converter patch I've found here ;.)
These are very basic as I'm still a pure-data noob, so if someone is interested to help refine the audio input part, this would be much appreciated (as much on the analysis part as on the ui/settings part).
Thanks for reading
PS: also in my case it would be even better if the chaser steps could be triggered by midi event instead of having a timing value, but this can't be done currently with available controls in QLC, so I've made a feature request to QLC dev and hope it gets attention&#8230;

624,Weird cyclic ring-mod tones,Weird cyclic ring-mod tones,"Hi everyone,
This is my first post, and I'm new to both PD and DSP, so any comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I set this up to test my first abstraction, and just sort of went mining for sounds. It resulted in some weird evolving tones, some are more pitchy others more noisy.
The abstraction ""chopper"" just takes two floats as input, and outputs a list of numbers that are equally spaced between the two input values (the list includes the two input values as the first and last elements of the list). The number of divisions is determined by the creation argument, which sets the overall length of the output list. The argument can only be between 0 and 9 because of how the abstraction is set up (any thoughts on a practical way to expand this range?) The argument can also be changed via the third inlet. The fourth inlet takes values 0 or 1 to determine which of the first two inlets are hot. The graph-on-parent radio does the same thing.
This patch uses ""chopper"" to control the partials of two tones, which are then multiplied together. So if the two input values are say 100 and 900, and the creation argument is 9, the output list is a harmonic series. Then if you move either the upper or lower value, you can kind of squish or stretch out the partials. Its really easy to get some noisy engine-like sounds.
Anyway, I set up some preset values to check out. Or just play with the number boxes to hunt for more sounds. There isn't really any control set up around it so its just basically on or off right now. You can also mess with the filter settings in the filter sub-patch.
Thanks for reading. Any suggestions/comments on either the patch or the abstraction are welcome!

Attached is a patch with a fixed-interval time domain octave harmonizer (octave down and up). The approach differs from regular time domain pitch shifting, and the result is also quite different. A delay is noticeable for the octave tones, but the harmonies are very smooth. No rough tones, as they are normally associated with time domain pitch shifters. It is therefore particularly suitable for long notes.

Here is a fairly small patch that I've been working on for the past day or so. I'm using two 3-oscillator FM synths that are playing random minor notes to form different chords. One synth has a short attack, medium decay, and a noticeable delay, while the other has a long attack and acts as a sort of synth pad.
I also added some drums into the mix, but I'm not really satisfied with them.
Anyway, it's nothing phenomenal and the guts form a very disorganized mess (I probably should have used more subpatches). Still, I like the sound and the mood it's producing... it kind of reminds me of a bowed vibraphone.
Check it out if you get the chance - It should just start if you press the big button but I'm fairly new to all of this stuff so I apologize if I screwed up the patching somewhere and it doesn't work (I think I'm getting a stack overflow error but I'm not sure where it's coming from or what it's doing.

there are four instruments (2 bassdrums, 1 snare, 1 hihat/cymbal thing), you can control their levels in the mix section
each instrument follows one of the tables at the right (not the fifth one)
to access each instrument's controls click the [pd controls] object. I won't explain each control, just try them. However, each instrument has a pink radio-strip, this selects which table the instrument currently uses. The brown radio skips notes.
to ad grit, use the woodfire section (beware of your ears, although it will diminish the output level). This is my go at a constant-output-level thing (is this some form of compression?).
there's a (vst) reverb section for which i normally use the free PSP pianoverb (its controls are mapped in the verb section parameters). The input to the plugin can follow the fifth table, by using the [folw] toggle. This might be a rather confusing section
there's an FM section which can follow the snare and/or hihat (blue toggles in the mix section). The five sliders in the main section control the fm amount/depth/filter
the green slider in the main section is the main level
the organe [hp] slider is the main highpass-level

Something about the tables. Each table has a set of controls:

Dark red clears the current pattern
Dark blue randomizes the entire pattern
Switch the green toggle on the record notes with the spacebar
Light red button clears all notes except the recorded ones
Light blue button randomizes all notes except the recorded ones
The buttons marked < and > shift the pattern left/right
The radiostrips selects an other pattern
Patterns can be loaded/saved by the green/red buttons bellow the radio strip
The very small green toggles enables/disables the auto-load-pattern function
The randomization depth is controlled by the yellow slider bellow
The orange slider / grey radio controls the number of steps played

Enjoy it.

652,Multi-voice wavtable synth (unfinished),Multi-voice wavtable synth (unfinished),"hi folks,
i decided to upload a synth i was working on for a long time now, but i still didn't finish it, because i haven't gor enough time.
it features two wavetable osc's with their own filters and amp-envelope. the standard waveforms consist of sine partials (amount choosable). theres an arpeggioator with different modes too. further i added an fx-bank with some real nice sounding standard fx (phaser, tremolo, delay, chorus, reverb, bit-crusher,..) - the integrated fx signal flow selector is a little buggy, but works for now.
theres a preset section with 5 saved presets at the moment (independent from the amount of voices).
i stuck on the modulation section as i have not enough time to work on it. browse the ""abs"" folder, there are some nice abstractions for different purposes in it. sorry for i never wrote a documentation for this thing.
maybe someone can use it or partts of it.
ps: by the way, this thing is a cpu hog, it uses something about 20 - 25 % of cpu power with 5 voices on my i5 notebook.

One issue i am having is when using a midi keyboard to control it, hitting a second key will cause a retriggering issue and mess up the original note, if you have any ideas let me know, what i am trying to make it do is for a second key being pressed to change pitch but keep the original envelope open, possibly the polyphonic version will fix this issue

670,Quark - aleatoric midi sequencer,Quark - aleatoric midi sequencer,"Hey fellas!
Presenting my first complete patch, but a pretty useful one (at least for me!).
Quark is an aleatoric midi sequencer which at a given tempo plays notes, randomly taken from a selected musical scale. Additional randomization options are available, such as volume, note duration and even dynamic scale changes. All open instances of the sequencer can be synced to each other and can additionally trigger Hydrogen to play in sync.
Quark was created to be used in a modular audio environment of a GNU/Linux system. On other systems sync between sequencer instances and Hydrogen might have little meaning. Quark was tested on GNU/Linux only.
From Pd perspective, the patch uses basic objects, but visually is a little messy. It is one of my first patches and by the time I found out about subpatches and abstractions, it was easier to leave it as it is. At the same time it is not a big patch at all, fitting on a laptop screen, and important sections are commented.

672,First complete patch,First complete patch,"I am very interested in getting feedback on this patch, which is a simple sampler with the option to play files in sequential order, random order, or overlapped randomly.
I built this as an exercise to learn about abstractions and the use of $0, $1 per the sticky post in the tutorials section.
TVS.pd is the main patch and TV.pd is the abstraction. I give each instance of TV.pd two arguments (1 2 for the first, 2 3 for the second, 3 4 for the third, etc). This is so that I can use the variables $1 and $2 in each abstraction - the variable $2 is always the function to stop playback. In this way, when playing samples in sequential order, the second sample functions to turn off playback on the first, the third turns off the second, etc.
For sequential playback I use:
[counter]
|
[select $1]
| |
[bang] [moses $2]
|
[select $2]
|
[bang]
You will find this in the TV.pd abstractions.
I would like feedback on this method, I suspect there is a more elegant way to achieve the same result.
I would also love help making a line~ that functions to stop digital clicks when changing samples.

This patch is just a combination of beat slicer and conway's ""game of life"".

683,Linux + PD + Korg Padkontrol + Native Mode,Linux + PD + Korg Padkontrol + Native Mode,"To all you Korg Padkontrol owners on Linux,
I finally figured out how to talk to the padkontrol, get it into native mode, and get it to spit sysex all within PD using the [midiin] or [sysex] and [midiout] objects.
'Native mode' is a special mode that the padkontrol can be set to that allows you access to ALL the buttons and knobs on the device. Those 2 buttons next to the Knobs? yours. The endless encoder under the LCD? yours.
The attached patch will get you in and out of native mode and has a bunch of subpatches to test and debug things. When you hit the start button, the lights should flash and then 'YES' will appear on the LCD. From there you can test the buttons, the LED light commands, the LCD commands, etc. All of the subpatches are just samples of how to use the data, rip them apart to make your own abstractions.
Technical Details:
Make sure your padkontrol is connected to PD using JACK or patchage to manage midi connections.
The initialize command sets up the midi channel on 10 (which is the default when it's out of native mode as well)
In native mode the pads will output 1 thru 16 on midi channel 10 AND output sysex messages too, both ways are shown in the patch.
The x-y pad is accessed through CC 16 and 17, again on midi channel 10

Lunettas are simple CMOS based synths. Logic chips and few other components are used, brought out to patch points and used in a modular fashion.
This patch is made in pd-vanilla. No default values are used, so to get it started you may have to tweak it a bit. As it is, it's a nice drone synth. It can easily be expanded to include other modules and complex functions.
The simulation includes 4 LFO/Clocks, 4-bit DAC, VCO. All modules have three selectable frequency ranges and manual pulse width control. Each LFO has a slider for manual pitch control.
I have some ideas for refinement, they mostly involve using the formulas for RC networks to determine frequency.

692,Psycho pitch delay,Psycho pitch delay,"just a little patch for playing around.
it's kind of of oldschool psycho delay - the audio signal is delayed in a buffer delayline AND pitched in a second (pitch) delay line with a forward or backward moving read index. to avoid clipping at the buffer end, the pitch vd~ is doubled (with different phased read index) and windowed with a hanning. this way, the feedback signal is getting higher and higher / lower and lower.
have fun!

701,Audio floatstream in the message domain,Audio floatstream in the message domain,"based on my last post (""universal bus"") i worked further to find a way, how to convert audio to a samplerate synced floatstream. this means, you can send an audio signal via a message cord, transformed to a floatstream.
you may ask: for what?
well, you can then use different message objects (or whatever) to edit the audio signal before you convert it back to audio, and then send it to the [dac~].
i always searched for a [tabwrite~] object, that was capable of accessing single indicies of an array. but tabwrite~ doesn't feature this, because audio is processed in blocks in pd.
but the message domain [tabwrite] can do this. so now you can use [tabwrite] to process audio too.
or maybe you want to create your own oscillators from scratch. this all is possible with a sample rate clock, like the one, used in this patch here.
just don't know what you folks think about that, but for me, this is a gate to a new world.

So this is my 'first' patch for it running a little bit like a step sequencer. I've zipped a load of other patches in there also that I made whilst trying to get this sorted.
I'll admit this is VERY messy. This is one of the reasons i'm posting it up, so anyone with a sound fresh mind can have a look and maybe give me some pointers?

On a side note. If you open up the Zip and open LaunchPad Step Sequencer List.pd that's the one i've got furthest on. If you plug in your launchpad, set it to midi device 1 in and out, then use IAC to go out to any software going to midi channel 1.

Basically I figured that it would be a good idea to start out trying out the non-audio parts of the language, and so I made a 16 step sequencer of sorts. You get 16 rows and you get to assign all of them a different MIDI channel. To get sound out of it, you should just pipe the MIDI data into VSTs or whatever accepts MIDI input. I personally tried this by sending MIDI through the IAC driver and into Reaper, where I had two instances of Kore Player as virtual instruments receiving data on different channels. There is also a keyboard-like thing for choosing which notes you want to put on a step.
Comments and critique very welcome!

713,Midi controller refresh rate evaluation patch : join the benchmark !,Midi controller refresh rate evaluation patch : join the benchmark !,"Hi,
while using Herrmutt Lobby's beatfader patch (), I felt like the cheap controller I were using had a rather limitated refresh rate (time resolution). This caused 'missed' samples triggerings.
This decided me to write a patch to TRY to retrieve directly this info from a played controller : simply connect it, play it and read a value.
I tested it with a stable midi LFO with different time resolutions, and the results are rather satisfactory.
This leads me to the idea that if this patch works, anyone anywhere on earth can pick up his own controller and make the test, and then share the results with the community. This retrieved information is nearly never given by constructors, and I would like this humble patch to become a friendly tool allowing us to compare devices on this criterion.
What do you think of it ?
How to use it :
* First bang the 'timebase'
* then move ONE controller at a time (no surface pads), rather rapidly till you find the higher 'stable enough' value given by the homebrew rate
Enjoy !
It's stupid by I couldn't test it under Pd because I don't have a controller here with me, but it has been ported to Max For Live and gives values around 60-70 hz with the hercules dj control mp3

741,University of York Weather Station Sonification/Visualisation,University of York Weather Station Sonification/Visualisation,"I made ""this weather"" in Pure Data to sonify and visualise the weather station data online at the University of York's website (http://weather.elec.york.ac.uk/). I wanted to give the data a sonic/visual narrative that could be easily understood.




Wind: White noise is the basis for the wind. Speed determines the value of a lowpass filter & gust speed determines the amplitude of the output. Direction is represented by the white noise's pan position.


Rain/hail: The amount of rain & hail that has fallen since midnight is used to control a the frequency of a sawtooth wave. The faster it oscillates, the more rain that has fallen. Rain is heard in the left audio channel, whilst hail is heard in the right.


Pressure: The air pressure controls the frequency of a sine wave generator. The low frequency is scaled to be audible to human ears.


Humidity/Dew Point: This data controls the duty cycle of a pulse wave. If humidity is very high, it will produce a thin and raspy tone and if it is low it will produce are 'fuller' sound. Dew point & humidity are closely related. Here, it affects the amplitude modulation of the pulse wave. The higher the dew point, the faster the modulation.


Temperature: Simple FM synthesis is used to represent temperature information. The overall temperature controls the pitch of the carrier wave, wind chill controls the modulator and wind speed controls the modulation amount.

I had the random [lop~]s running straight into the [*~ 0.3]. Then I thought maybe a [delay] and some more filtration might help. It seems to make some difference (I don't think the [delay] is doing anything though).
If you delete the:
[delay~]

745,Identify the pitch,Identify the pitch,"Hello
I made this patch so I can train my ears to recognize notes by just hearing them. I know it will take time before I get good at it, that is why I built this.
The patch is very simple but I've made the instructions very detailed in case someone who has never used Pure Data (some of my friends) is trying it out.
1. Turn on the DSP (Digital Signal Processor)
2. Turn the volume up (click on the white bar on the right and raise it)
3. Choose for how long you want to hear the note by clicking on the section called ""Seconds"". The default is 2 seconds.
4. Click on the black corner that asks you to click if you want to know the new random note you'll hear next. You'll see the note appear next to the cube with the ""New Random Note"" and ""Repeat"" bang (black squares)
5. Press bang (black square) under ""New Random Note"" to hear a new note and under ""Repeat"" to repeat the last new random note heard. You may instead use your keyboard and press the letters N and R. Repeat will not tell you the note, it will only play it for you. The feature that tells you what note you just heard only works with ""New Random Note"".
6. If you want a tone of reference so you can figure out the random note you just heard then press the A:440 bang (button) or just press the letter A on your keyboard.
Hope you like it.

much more is planned for this. but i have another project for a little while.
it should work in vanilla pd, but i just tried it on my linux machine and realized that an older computer with a low resolution monitor won't show the entire patch. version 2 will probably fix that as well. also i still haven't added record from adc~, also will be added in version 2.
also, there is no readme or instructions, but it should all be pretty straight forward.
the 2 sliders below the arrays are for left edge select and right edge select. mix,paste etc all begin at the left edge. make sure you keep the right edge select in front of the left edge, or else weird stuff might happen and pd could crash. i will add a safeguard for that in version 2 as well.
also, long vertical slider on the left hand side changes pitch. this is a handy function which i have never seen in a sound editor before.

Following the Pd Berlin meeting last Tuesday, the guys encouraged me to share my patches.
Here are my step sequencers for Pd vanilla. With a bit of imagination they can be used for many things other than beat/drum patterns. In the example patches you can see one used as a metro to drive the other sequencers which can lead to interesting groove/swing/shuffle sounds. Also to repetitively control parameters like filter cutoff/pitch/LFO rate/effects on synthesizers too. Connect them to each other to create conditionally generative randomness. All these methods are employed in the example patches.

well, i bought myself a xaphoon lately, which is kind of a pocket saxophone and right now i'm struggling to learn how to read the musical notes and how to get them played with the instrument.
i threw a little patch together which helps me get started.
it includes only the basic notes of my instrument, but for now it's ok, maybe i'll upgrade it sometime.
maybe someone here starts playing an instrument, too, so he could transfer/tune the patch for his instrument.
it's also very expandable: i guess it wouldn't be too hard to programm a song which you would play along a la guitar hero (also with gem maybe). you could even program it to write down the notes (pitch and even length in the notation system)if you play something freestyle.
if someone makes more of it, please share with us, thanks!

second patch to publish. It is not quite a a beat slicer. It cuts the sample into 32 parts of exact the same length. You can rearrange them via the matrix made from |hradios|. I think it should be pretty self explanatory, how to use it.
I got the idea from a youtube video but i modified the way, the sequencing is handled. In my version, the sequencer moves from top to bottom, now the black square from the |hradio| is in the exact spot as the slice in the table above. You will see what i mean when you take a look at the screnshot attached or the patch itself.
In the future there will be effects to add for each slice (scratch, retrigger, pitch shift etc.), but as for today, this is as far as i got.

777,Bandlimited oscillators,Bandlimited oscillators,"This is a collection of abstractions that generate bandlimited oscillators. They include:
[bl-saw.mmb~] - bandlimited sawtooth waveform
[bl-pulse.mmb~] - bandlimited pulse wave with PWM
[bl-tri.mmb~] - bandlimited triangle wave
[bl-asymtri.mmb~] - bandlimited asymmetrical triangle wave (sort of...see below)
There is also an object called [bl-init.mmb]. This is the object that initializes all the waveforms and at least one instance MUST be included in order for the others to work.
There are also help patches included. 
IMPORTANT!
Before you can use these, you must do the following steps.
1. Open [bl-init.mmb]
2. There is a message box that says [44100(. This is the maximum sampling rate that these will work at (running at lower sampling rates will be fine). If you plan on using higher sampling rates, change this message box and click it. Technically, it will still work at a higher sampling rate, but it won't generate harmonics above the sampling rate in this box.
3. Click the [bang( to fill the wave tables. This patch actually creates a wavetable for EVERY harmonic between 30Hz and the Nyquist frequency. So it will take a few minutes. Be patient! You will get a message in the Pd window when it is done.
4. Save the patch.
Once you do this, [bl-init.mmb] will simply load with the tables already generated, so you don't have to wait every time you instantiate it. I didn't have this already done for you in order to keep the upload small, and so you can see how to adjust it if you need to.
So, I guess I'll go ahead and try to explain how these work. As stated above, every harmonic is generated in [bl-init.mmb] for the oscillators. It doesn't create a table for each set of harmonics however (e.g., there isn't a saw table with two harmonics, a saw table with three harmonics, etc.). Instead, each of these individual tables are tacked on to the end of each other to create one long wave table. So, for each set of 1027 samples in the sawtooth wavetable, there is one cycle with a set amount of harmonics.
When the oscillators read the frequency input, it is divided into the Nyquist frequency to determine how many harmonics are needed. It then uses this (* 1027) as the offset for the table. This is how I got around the problem of table switching at block boundaries. By doing this way, the ""switching"" is done at audio rate.
There are actually two [tabread4~]s. One has one less harmonic than the other. As the frequency changes it crossfades between these tables. When one table goes completely silent, that's when it ""switches."" Below 30Hz, they switch to geometrically perfect waveforms.
[bl-saw.mmb~] and [bl-tri.mmb~] just read through the tables. Nothing really interesting about them.
[bl-pulse.mmb~] is actually the difference between to sawtooths. In other words, there are two bandlimited sawtooth oscillators inside of it. Adjusting the pulse width cause the phase of one of the sawtooths to shift. When you subtract this phase-shifted sawtooth from the other, it creates a bandlimited pulse wave...without oversampling! This is the same Phase Offset Modulation method used in Reason's SubTractor.
[bl-asymtri.mmb~] uses the same technique as [bl-pulse.mmb~], except it uses bandlimited parabola waves instead of sawtooths. Adjust the phase offset sets where the top vertex is. This doesn't really generate true triangle or saw waves, though. They still have the parabolic curve in them, so the harmonics seem to come out a little more. It's more of a ""reasonable approximation."" But, it is bandlimited, and it does sound pretty cool to modulate the shape. I don't have the scaling quite right yet, but I'll get to it later...maybe. 
I should also mention that these use my [vphasor.mmb~] abstraction, so the phase reset is sample accurate.
I'll eventually set these up to allow frequency and pulse-width arguments, but I'm currently in the process of moving to another country, so it may be a little bit before I get around to it.
Didn't any of that make any sense?

784,Loader and Playback,Loader and Playback,"Here's a part of a patch I've been working on for a few weeks.
It's a file-loader with a linear scrub option. When the toggle for Scrub is checked, a second [hsl] appears that allows you to scrub to a specific spot, and lets you choose how long the scrub is to get to that spot.
So far, I think the only limitation I've found is this: if you activate the scrubbing while it is already playing back, then it will not accurately show what the current playback speed is.
The playback engine is separate so that I could use [switch~] to turn it off when it isn't playing anything back.
Unzip the three patches into a folder and open loadandplay1.pd (the main patch).
Also, thanks to everyone on the forum for being a great resource. My knowledge of pd is a direct result of the great help and insights given to me by all on the forum.

Requires PD-Extended 0.41, check out INSTALL for instructions.
It requires muug~ http://puredata.hurleur.com/viewtopic.php?pid=17403#p17403 which is included in this zip in a folder named extra-externals (binaries for Windows and OS 10.5 already compiled). In extra-externals there is also a popup.dll. I found that popup does not work properly in windows and made a fix for it. I submitted it here:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2985017&group_id=55736&atid=478070
But I included my fix here anyway. It was compiled with MinGW. First see if your version of popup exhibits this error:
error: popup0xa4fda0: no such object
while attempting to select an item from the list. If so replace it with the provided dll. It should be in the PD folder under extra/flatspace
It uses OSC instead of midi but there is a midi to osc interpreter. There's also a computer keyboard to osc interpreter but it doesn't work very well.
Check out minimoog-hep.pd
You can load more than one minimoog at a time but you'll have to use different OSC ports for each instance.
Thoroughly tested in OS X. Quickly tested in Windows and Linux. In Linux it tends to crash PD when closing the patch.
I made a repository for it here

So if you'd like to include some changes let me know.

Sorry for the jumble there, I'm still not sure about what things are called.
To use it, dump this patch in your extras folder (or in the path somewhere) and when you want to track a marker, make an [rct_marker x] object in your patch with X representing which fiducial you want to track. The object will output, in order, Added, Removed, X-axis, Y-axis, and Angle. Added and Removed are bangs and the other three are floats.
Okay. I'm calm now. I love succeeding in these little tasks I set for myself.

second patch to publish. It is not quite a a beat slicer. It cuts the sample into 32 parts of exact the same length. You can rearrange them via the matrix made from |hradios|. I think it should be pretty self explanatory, how to use it.
I got the idea from a youtube video but i modified the way, the sequencing is handled. In my version, the sequencer moves from top to bottom, now the black square from the |hradio| is in the exact spot as the slice in the table above. You will see what i mean when you take a look at the screnshot attached or the patch itself.
In the future there will be effects to add for each slice (scratch, retrigger, pitch shift etc.), but as for today, this is as far as i got.
I hope to get some feedback this time!

Then, a ""folding"" operation is performed on the modulating waveform.

The result is interesting. The sound is smoother than the basic hard-sync trick using just [wrap~]
The attached patch is proof of concept and noticeably prone to aliasing.
It will sound better at lower pitches, the wave displays will make more sense at higher pitches

818,"Touch Screen Sequencer, PureData and Python","Touch Screen Sequencer, PureData and Python","Hi all,
I feel that this is now at the point where i can start showing it to people and possibly getting some feedback. This is based off a Midi sequencer i wrote for the NDS but is now aimed at my touchscreen tablet which has a much bigger area to play with.
everything can be downloaded from my github repository
http://github.com/notesandvolts/Touch-Sequencer
The sequencer has two parts :-
Pure Data sequencer does all of the data stuff, midi sequencing, value storing.
The Python GUI just makes everything easier to use and a bit prettier than stock PD. It uses pygame for all the graphical stuff so you will need this to be installed as well.
The two communicate over OSC and my eventual plan is to have the tablet communicate with a rackmounted server over a wireless netwwork.
Features
2 channel types, Grid and Curve. Grid features 8 grid based patterns either 8 * 16 or 16 * 32 sized grids. The patterns themselves are sequencable and there is a follow mode that shows the patterns being played on a channel so you can more easily edit it on the fly.
The curve channel features 8 wavetable LFOs with user drawable waveforms, variable lengths and independant midi channel capabilities. They currently only do standard Midi CCs and no pitch bend but thats something I want to change soon.
The sequencer sends out Midi clock start/stop/clock information so it can be used as a master clock for a bunch of gear. It currently doesn't sync to a midi clock but again i'd like to do that eventually.
I've tested the whole thing a bit and it works however i'm sure there are going to be more issues. Any feedback is welcome, even if its people just giving advice on how to do something better. The user interface is currently ugly but then i'm an engineer not a graphical designer 
I hope people find this useful or informative or hopefully both.
Thanks for taking a look

819,Handy little oxygen8 midi middleman patch,Handy little oxygen8 midi middleman patch,"hi guys! so i've had an oxygen8 for a few years now and i see them everywhere, so i'm sharing this handy little patch i made.
basically you're stuck with 8 knobs, and two sliders (modwheel and data entry). all this patch really does is takes the keyboard's input, numbers those 8 knobs and 2 sliders in sets of 10, and lets you switch between those sets with the hradio for up to 120 different controller values. the key input is passed straight through so even when you switch between various controls you can play the keyboard consistently.
even if you don't have an oxygen8, this patch will give you a little selfcontained set of sliders that you can use as a midi controller... so it's still useful for when you're not at home with your keyboard, or if you don't even have one.
basically all this patch does is take those 10 controls and lets you switch between 12 sets of them. it's useful for me in ableton so when i need to map more parameters than i have knobs for, i can assign more, and the numbering system is much easier to stay on top of than the default control values for those knobs (it's like 17, 80, 74, no consistency it seems).
on linux you should be able to jack the keyboard to pd's midi in, then jack the output to wherever you want. i'm currently on windows and i select usb keyboard in for input, and loopbe for output.
the numbers do nothing but change when you switch the hradio - the sliders are the corresponding controls (with the mod wheel as slider 9 and the data entry knob as slider 10).
come to think of it i don't think i tested the pitch bend wheel, i've been using this patch almost entirely for parameter controlling and not playing the oxygen8 notes at all. [notein] is patched directly into [noteout]
any questions/comments/ideas please, post them. this is a real quick patch i put together that worked almost better than i wanted it to but it can be very expanded upon. i was going to add symbols so you could tag/name all 120 controls but i was having trouble figuring out a way to store them and recall them, and send/receive to the symbols... so i just scrapped that.
basically all i do is make a tiny pd window and make [SCET], and just have that sitting at the bottom of the screen under my DAW (in this case ableton).
i haven't run into any conflicts yet for the most part but it's possible the controller numbering system might conflict with certain apps/synths/etc.
cheers guys!

820,Sensory substitution in PD,Sensory substitution in PD,"Hi all,
I've just finished a crude prototype of a reverse engineered Sensory Substitution Device. It's based on a bit of software available at http://www.seeingwithsound.com/ and basically converts a webcam image into a sound signal.
To run it, (you'll need a webcam attached) first launch the GEM window (big green bang) then click the ""Run"" toggle.
There are a couple of things I'd like to change:


As I've discussed in other topics, I'd like the samples to be of areas rather than points. If anyone knows a way to lower the resolution of a pix in PD, I'd love to hear from you.


Presently the abstracted patch which converts the pixels to sound is repeated 64 times (one for each sample). This seems like an inelegant way to do things. In other programming languages one would loop through 0 to 63 and instantiate the patch for each value. I've seen talk about internal messages, but didn't really get it - does anyone have an example of this?


Thanks,
Tom

Long time lurker, first time poster. I've been working in PD for about a month now
still new to it but learning quickly with the help of all knowledge shared on this forum.
After making a a few horrendously ugly patches, I finally have something pretty usable that I'd like to share and get some feedback and help on.
I took a patch that diplipito and Maelstorm worked on that originally dealt with timestretching /pitch and added some beat mangling code that I got from another patch. I figured out how to add my extra controls to the graph on parent, and added some midi control code so I can adjust things with the knobs on my korg Padkontrol.
It mostly works the way I want, the reverse is alittle funky, and I'd like to add a 'retrigger' button.
Eventually, I'd like to separate the sample controls so I can use them for more than one sample player...I'd like to be able to switch the controls between different sample players like channels.
I've followed a few threads here about using phasor~ samphold~ and edge~ to make sequencers. I want to see if I can wire 4 samplers together with a global phasor~ to keep time. And I read some stuff about bonk~ being able to detect beats...I'd like to try using that to drive a u_samplekit from rjdj.

I know everyone is busy with some technical issues, but I need to ask you something as a community, developers and people who have deep knowledge in technology like pd and audio.
I'm writing a small research on the delay effects and what I made with pd is the Delay with amplitude controlled output. I mean that output amount depends on input amount. Some objects like [line] makes it work smooth and and control this parameter. I use it for life performance and usually never overload amount of echo even at critical amounts of feedback for monophonic instrument. For that purpose I used a patch of Maelstorm.mmb as delay core and made some simple upgrades like stereo and ""Folow"" function.
I'm asking for any opinion from you in any aspects or maybe you did something like that for other purpose long ago. I want to use that information for my research.
Patch I attached isn't cpu effective and more a demonstration tool. I hope ones interested will find file to load and play or plug something in [adc~].

841,V2MSy is out (alpha),V2MSy is out (alpha),"Hi, my patch v2MSy (video to midi synth) is downloadable from <http://adrjork.altervista.org/puredatatutorials.html>. I hope you like it. Basically it's smilar to MetaSynth but my patch works with video or webcam in real time, and not with image. The patch transforms the central Y axis of the video into 128 MIDI signals (from bottom to top) at 25fps (metro at 40ms). The result is a detailed ""notation"" of the video's central axis where the white pixels represent velocity=127 and black pixels represent velocity=0 (very similar to carillons' mechanism where video stays for the cylinder!)
The patch contains also two indipendent subpatches: an interface for BCF2000 and a ""poor"" interface for keyboard&mouse.
You need a receiving software to ""play"" or ""write"" MIDI noteouts (like a sequencer).
To connect the patch to the receiving-software I use a virtual MIDI cable. I think you can use MidiYoke in Windows, or ALSA in Linux, or IAC driver in Mac. But if you want also feedback for your motorized BCF2000 you should set PD's MIDI settings with ""multiple devices""...that doesn't work! Because it seems that only the 1st output device works... So I do in this way:
IAC driver (I use Mac) + MIDI Patchbay
and I set:
-BCF2000 as PD MIDI input
-IAC driver as PD MIDI output
-IAC driver as Patchbay input
-BCF2000 as Patchbay output
In this way, Logic receives MIDI signals from v2MSy, and my Behringer has feedback!
Please, test the patch in Windows or Linux and write if ALSA and MidiYoke do the work and give feedback. Thanks.

this works quite well, if your arraysize is always a multiple to the blocksize and your the minimum delaytime is one block (~1.45125 ms).
further i had to add a normal delayline (delwrite~/vd~ pair) for the feedback loop, otherwise pd gave mean error message, that a dsp loop occured.
this way you have access to more functions than in a normal delayline, for example you can now adjust the bufferlength on the fly, etc.....
ok, this is not a reinvention of the wheel, but the technic to work in blocksize and use a delay of one blocksize for the reading position gives you the possibility of building simple ring buffers with arrays and if you stop the writing process(i did not implement yet...), your delay will save it's buffer data, it will not be lost!

845,Basic Wii patches for OSCulator/PD-extended combos,Basic Wii patches for OSCulator/PD-extended combos,"I'm prepping for a course at the University I teach at and have come up with these basic patches that read out data from a Wiimote, Nunchuk and Balance Board. I have the Classic Controller but didn't bother to set up a patch for it (that is an assignment for my students down the road). Anyhow, I thought some of you might find this useful as a starting point. The Wii Balance Board patch does have an example of really basic noteon/off functionality with weight in the bottom left and right corners of the board. Keep in mind, however, this is a super duper basic example to get the minds of my students jump started.
To get started:
1.) Start OSCulator (if you don't have it, get it!)
2.) Open the Wii Balance Board or Wiimote and Nunchuk OSCulator files (I created two different files for two different projects - you can easily combine both on your own)
3.) Click the Wiimote Drawer icon and connect your Wiimotes/Wii-peripherals (to connect Balance Board, push the red button in the battery compartment)
4.) Take note of what number controller your Wiimote is connected to in the drawer. You may have to change number in the [routeOSC /3] object where '3' represents the number of the wiimote in the drawer (yes, it is a tad confusing).
5.) *IMPORTANT* - The OSCulator patches are set to output on localhost:9000. In the next steps, your [udpreceive 9000] must be set to receive on port 9000 and NO OTHER PATCH CAN BE USING PORT 9000 (look for the dashed red box as an indication of it not working right)
6.) Open the corresponding Pd patch (ie. if using Balance Board OSCulator file, open Balance Board pd patch).
7.) Nerd out and explore possibilities! The Balance board patch is already set to send out an E, F# and B on MIDI channel 1. I use the IAC Bus to route the MIDI to other programs on the MAC. This, of course, is a tutorial in and of itself, so I'll let you gather that information on your own (it is out there).
I'll probably make some tutorial vidz of this and other lessons as the class progresses over the next two quarters (20 weeks). Finally, the .zip was created using the standard 'compress files' feature of OSX 10.5. I've found that sometimes this can create problems on PC (but then, OSCulator is Mac only so I figure it doesn't matter).

848,Breakbeat - Resequencing.,Breakbeat - Resequencing.,"Heres a little something I came up with today.
It's still a bit buggy, but hopefully someone can point out how to fix those things to me.
Heres how it works:
When you load in a file, the length in samples is loaded, and divided by however many beats you have set.
Through the magic of counting, numbers are sent through [select] and then on to the sequencer.
The sequencer is a series of vertical radios, and to play the file properly through(after choosing the correct tempo) you will need a diagonal line from top left to bottom right.
But as you click around to other squares, you will find yourself repeating certain beats. voila.
Sometimes it decides to count past the numbers ive limited it too because for some reason, a toggle inside module>counting, hasnt undone its self, or was turned on after passing this point.
I just added in a few different metro speeds that suited the loops i was playing.
Issues;
I think i should stick in something that will stop it playing after a certain time, so rather than have it continue playing the file from the beat selected, if you know what i mean.
If i could work out how to make the sequencers open when the patch is opened that might make finding it easier, right now you have to go into module>sequencer, not too hard i guess.
I would explain it in further detail, but I have dinner and a show to get to.
Criticism and hints on how i could improve this would be much appreciated.
Edit: I'll also add a thanks to obi, with his fairly efficient drum patch, for inspiring the [select] based sequencing.

For Debian based systems (including Ubuntu), you'll have to do a little command-fu. First, go to sourceforge and download the latest i386 rpm file. I know, you thought that you were done with rpms, but... you're not.
Open up a command line and issue the following commands as root in the directory that you downloaded it (probably ~/Desktop):

  apt-get install alien

  alien -d tkdnd*.rpm
  dpkg --install tkdnd*.deb

2.
in a /usr/lib/pd/bin directory is pd.tk file
replace procedure pdtk_canvas_makeobjs with these lines:
proc pdtk_canvas_makeobjs {name files x y} {
    set c 0
    for {set n 0} {$n < [llength $files]} {incr n} {

    set absolute [lindex $files $n]   

    if {[regexp {.*/(.+).pd$} $absolute file obj] == 1} {
            pd $name obj $x [expr $y + ($c * 30)] [pdtk_enquote $obj] \;
            incr c
        } elseif {[regexp {.*/(.+).(wav|WAV|aiff|AIFF)$} $absolute file obj] == 1} {

            set tmp [string trimleft $absolute ""file:""]
            set filename [file join / $tmp]   

            pd $name obj $x [expr $y + ($c * 30)] [concat ""table "" $obj \;]       
            pd PDTK_ondrop [concat ""??????"" $filename] $obj $x $y \;
            incr c
            }
    }
}

That's it. Now you should be able to drop a soundfile on a patch and everything else should be done dynamically.
See included test patch to see how it works.
Hope someone will find it usefull.
Have a nice day.

871,96-count master clock (for ACID patch),96-count master clock (for ACID patch),"Okay, so this things works; I say that first cause when you open it up your palm will probably hit your forehead.
The idea is that there is only one metro for the clock and that it is sending out different streams. So you run the clock (after adjusting shuffle and tempo - move shuffle up to 5 and back down to 0) and then anywhere else in your patch you can:
[r this] ; outputs a stream (at 16th note intervals) 0, 1, 2, 3,....15
[r this96] ; outputs a stream (at 96th note intervals) 0, 1, 2, 3,.....95
[r these] ; outputs a stream (at eight-note intervals) 0, 1, .....31 (4 bars instead of one, controlled by the ""phrase buttons 1bar, 2bar or 4bar.)
Some of the others are used by the ACID patch previously posted...the way I setup 16th-note triplets and 32nd-notes is messy, but you could get it to work for you. I think they are and ...
There are some graphics to lag your computer whenever 4-bar, 8-bar, 16-bar periods have elapsed.
You can also:
[r bang4] or [r bang8] which gives you bangs on important phrases.
It also has a built in stutter (unfortunately using another metro.) It stutters the clock output - works pretty well but it's a damn mess. It's under [pd keyboard] because I use a MIDI controller for it. If you can figure it out, more power to you - basically, if you have a MIDI controller you should be able to get it working - it uses thirteen keys C -> C Pressing any of these keys should give you some rhythm, like repeat count 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, unless you also hold down the lower C which would give you 5, 6, 5, 6 or the D which would give you 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 7...there's other stuff too.
If you're trying to get the ACID to work, don't worry, it should do it just fine, all the sends and receives are there. Put both files in your PD folder, open a new patch, and make an object [ACID4u] and [Clock4u] and they should be talking to each other.

872,ACID Sequencer for MIDI controlled Analog Synth,ACID Sequencer for MIDI controlled Analog Synth,"Hello,
This is what I have been using to control my Paia Fatman which is just a simple analog synth with two sawtooth oscillators. It is very nice to have digital control over analog sound - best of both. It would take some exploring for you to figure the stuff, and I doubt that many folks will have identical equipment.
The feature I'm most proud of is the gui for rhythmic control - you may program in 16 steps, 24 steps, or 32 steps, or all at once.
This is why you need a 96-count master clock which I'll post after this (it should be under abstractions but oh well.)
So feel free to rip off my GUI layout for whatever you need it for - I know it's a pain in the ass setting up all the sends (which I did lazily anyway.) There are also some random-material manipulators that are half badass...find the ""fatphraser"" subpatch. The idea is that you put in an acid line and it generates variations to create a convincing 4-bar phrase...different each time of course.
There is some small help info - look at [pd readtables] for a better idea of what you're dealing with in terms of data juggling.
And remember - this will not make any sound - it is simply sending MIDI information out of your computer to an external MIDI device. You could rig it to a soft-synth.

The example they give is:

Once I have some more time to program it, my next effect will probably be a Vocoder.
Run effectsrig.pd to load it up. A midi expression pedal is recommended for the best experience - but it's not required.
It contains the following effects:
whammy~
Digitech whammy style pitch shifter. Allows for smooth changes to the pitch shift amount.
Based on the one posted by ""kenn"" on the puredata.info forums (which in turn is based on the pd example code).
shimmer~
A ""shimmer"" synth-like effect. This is done with a pitch shift in a feedback loop of a very short delay.
octfuzz~
Octave-up distortion like you can obtained with the classic transform and 2 diodde rectifier circuit. Basically it just full-wave rectifies the audio signal. This one really brings out the high frequencies (some times a little too much!).
leslie~
A stereo leslie (rotating speaker) simulator. This is one of my favorites. If modulation is turned all the way down it becomes tremolo. Take one of the outlets for mono use. Try it in stereo for super-swirley bliss! When using an expression pedal to control the rate, heel down will bypass the effect.
Expression pedal control is done by expression.pd. It simply reads in MIDI and scales it to a 0->1 range. You can change the midi channel used by editing this file.
The preset system is a little hack-ish, but it works for me. If anyone has any better ideas on how to do this, I'd love to hear them. When you load up the main effectsrig.pd file, you will see a bunch of message boxes. This are quick settings buttons - just click one to apply that effect. They are designed so you can click a couple in a row to quickly apply a few different settings. To start over, click the big ""default"" one on the left.
It can also load presets based on midi messages. I use this with my Eventide TimeFactor pedal. When I change presets on the TimeFactor, PD follows along. This is handled by the box in the top right. The symbol box is for song titles, and the number boxes show the current TimeFactor preset. Open this box to see how I've done a couple of example midi controlled presets. ""pd your_love_never_fails"" is a more complicated example that changes the expression pedal behavior slightly.
If you want to use a different midi channel for listening to program changes, just edit preset.pd and presetnum.pd. preset.pd outputs a bang when the preset number supplied as a parameter is chose. presetnum.pd just outputs the number of the selected preset.

The number of slices can be changed during playback, the change won't take place until the next slice, so it is possible to start with an unsliced loop, slice it in half... then in 4ths etc.
There is also a 'random' option that randomly plays slices of 1/2 1/4 1/8 or 1/16 length.

888,The Continuator - a similar patch in PD?,The Continuator - a similar patch in PD?,"Hi all,
I'm working on a prototype for my thesis and I'm basically creating a very simple motion-based midi controller that tries to roughly simulate an air piano. I'm using junXion v4 to track motion and then send the data/midi to the synthesizer (Ableton Live) and this is working nice.
However, to make things more engaging, I would like my input midi sequence to be ""re-played"" as if the ""system"" was responding to my notes, that is engaging in a kind of a dialogue (similar to: http://www.csl.sony.fr/~pachet/video/Children.mp4).
I would sincerely appreciate if someone might give a simple quick&dirty idea / trick /patch that would help me achieve something similar to that? I'm really not a programmer and i'm inexperienced in PD so programing markov probabilistic transitions or implementing other generative techniques would be kinda out of my league.

It takes 9 taps (yielding 8 durations, so superficially it's tied to 2 repeating bars of beats in 4/4 though of course given that you can tap out any rhythm in those 8 beasts, you can feed it any meter you like). Also it's scaleable. I nicked hardoff's toggle because I thought it was pretty.
You could probably ""improve"" it by resetting the metro counter on tap 8 (so that the metro immediately goes into your sequence as you finish. That's probably a matter of taste though.

the original idea was to be able to modulate the volume of another loop with a field recording, for instance a babbling brook
What I have already:
I have two recorded loops one that plays to the dac~ and one that gets read via tabplay~ & snapshot~ and is then sent to the right inlet of a *~ right before the dac~ for the first loop.
Problem:
Either i am crazy or its not working quite the way i had envisioned it and it may be my computer giving it a bit more of a glitchy sound than i am looking for in this patch
Solution:
am i bng'ing the snapshot to often?
is tabplay & snapshot not the ideal pair for this kind of thing?
Perhaps i am just over complicating this
Maybe an oscillator should be used somewhere?
so has anybody worked on something similar or have any ideas i have included a very nasty looking patch
thanks

to do if this works:
add live input that could still be modulated by a recorded sound or an oscillator or some kind

I have wanted to do a key-taur VJ battle for awhile now and I'm starting to get it going. The key-taur will only have 5 keys but it will also have a pick pad that uses a fiducial tracker AKA Reactavision to further modulate samples and video. I have attached my first version of the patch and want to know what other people think and how I might be able to improve it.
I have fiducial tracking manipulating the size of the rectangle the video is textured on right now. It will definetly not be that way in the end.
We plan to wire up anrduino to drive the buttons and led's on the key-taur. I imagine I will need some help when I get to that part. We want to have a working version of the key-taur in about two months. Also we are thinking about adding an accelerometer for even more modulation capabilities. We plan to make two and our theme is analog versus digital even thought we are not taking that to the maxis. The analog key-taur will be corded but we are trying to make the digital one wireless.
So print out some fiducials if you don' have a set and give this thing a try.

Hi there,
I've made this little rhythm recorder. It's very simple and it's not supposed to make grooves or repeated patterns. It's just a recorder that takes input from a bang or the microphone, and stores the tempo map into an array, so you can reproduce it later. I'm interested in reproduce the subtle tempo changes from conventional instruments performance's, that's why it has no quantization. You can drag a slider to choose where you want to start the playback.
It has a augmentation/diminution feature, and if you doubled the player, you could generate rhythmic canons by augmentation, etc.
If you guys know any interesting patches about rhythmic procedures, I would love to know.

It's an example of waveshaping with attack and release settings. Could be made better by using tabsend~ and tabread~ but I'm not sure how to make the phasor~ work in phase with the block size.
table waveshape holds the distortion table, and table distortion is what is actually used to shape the signal. What's in waveshape is mixed with a linear signal in accordance with the attack and release settings.

Now I've got something that almost does what I intended!
When you toggle record on, it starts writing to a large temporary table. When you toggle it off, it copies the contents of the temporary table to the table called $1 (in [pd tablecopy]). While it's playing, you can overdub by toggling [dub] and punch by toggling [pch].
Issues: If you push play too soon after you finish recording, it plays the first time through okay, and then makes this terrible block-sized-feedback noise. Strangely, if you toggle record again after this happens, it finishes playing the loop normally as it starts recording again (try it). So you have to wait to push play. Ideally, it would work like a looper pedal and start playing back immediately after you stop recording.
Also, there's a glitch when it wraps around to the beginning of the table (you can't overdub a steady tone and expect it to play without a gap).
I want to use a table at some point because I really want the ability to load a wav file and overdub it, and to give other parts of my main patch access to my loop to chop it up, granularize it, and otherwise manipulate it. Is there a way to do this while fixing all the above issues?

935,How to organize hard disk space for older projects compatibility,How to organize hard disk space for older projects compatibility,"Hello to everybody,
I would discuss with you about some good philosophy for organize PD patches in order to have the most number of projects ready to work in a given time.
I have an intensive work on PD for digital music creation and development. For me is usual spend a lot of time when I re-open an old working project and find it doesn't work now, because in the meanwhile I have optimized some self made abstraction or external.
If you use the same abstractions/externals in more than a patch (I hope;-), often is necessary and useful make them better to improve your current projects, but the old project architectures now are probably out of order... THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR ME.
yesterday I found out a trick, perhaps many of you know it or have a better method.
Is possible to refer to your patches from any part of your hard disk by writing a path on the actual object you create inside PD e.g.:
C:/pd/synth/myabstraction [example of absolute path]
../synth/myabstraction [example of relative path]
So if you want to use the object delay you have in your computer, then make a new object and write on it [C:/pd/dsp/delay] if this is the path.
MY METHOD is this:
I have a folder named ""pd"" and subfolders named synth, dsp, external etc... I refer from every new project I do.
---> this is my environment for development
Every time I start a new project I save it inside this folder and I refer to the abstraction/externals I use by writing RELATIVE paths on the new objects.
When the project is finishes (ok, works is enough  I simply save a pd folder CLONE in another part of my hard disk and I name it with the project name.
In this way I continue to develop the ""pd"" folder, make new projects, BUT the old ones are well separated and... EVERY TIME WORKING for me.
what do you think about?
Have good pd projects !

There was some kind of issue with the fact that it looked impossible to make separate scalar (template?) objects. - to be able to draw one shape for the prey and another for the predator.
That was a while ago now and since then I became quite busy with other projects and forgot all about this one (and the problems I wanted solving).
Anyway, posting it here for you to explore and enjoy, comment, hopefully through discussion we can remember and better the issues I uncovered.

This is a simple patch which demonstrates a linear interpolation implementation of tabread and tabread~, which might be helpful to those at the beginning of their Pd journey. The [wrap]/[wrap~] objects are used to find the decimal of the requested index location, which is then used as a sort of cross-fader between the points at index location n and index location n+1.
These abstractions would be nice for those who are looking to array-based sequencing and are not fond of tabread4/tabread4~'s mangling of values at integer index values (ie: approximation error at integer index points).
Pd experts, if their is a more efficient way to do this, I'd like to know for my own knowledge.

957,Contiunous writing and reading arrays.,Contiunous writing and reading arrays.,"I am in the process of trying to make a patch that will continously record incoming sound, and then process this sound in various ways(from various playback-modes, speed change, perhaps vocoding shit, etc.). The main idea is to not have to press a button or rely on a timer or whatever to keep writing to an array, but to have the processing occur sort of all the time, or at least when sound is coming in). So far I played around a little with tabsend~ (for writing the audio to an array/table), and tried to use tabplay~ and tabread4~ for playing back parts of the incoming audiostream. I had best results with tabread4~, with the index controlled by a phasor~, after I made an array that was 1 second long that got written to with tabsend~. It worked, somehow, but it had pop's and click's and what not at seemingly random intervals. I guess it's because when you are trying to read what is being written at the same time, you get conflicts and hence these artifacts. I imagine you could perhaps try to use several arrays for writing, and in a way only look up where it is not being written to. Pardon my sloppy articulation on the matter here, I hope you get what I mean. I saw a friend using max, and there he had sort of this index-number coming out of the object he used for recording to a buffer, but PD's ""tabwrite"" and ""tabsend"" do not appear to have such things(although I guess if i use tabwrite I could have a metro with a counter or similar to get the idea of how it goes). Anything like it in PD, like a way to recieve the index of just where tabsend~ is writing in the array? Or have I misunderstood a bit, do tabsend~ actually just record one ""block"" at a time(so if I put a block at 44100 to correspond with my array of 1 seconds length, it only get updated once a second?).
Have anyone here attempted such a project, or know the theory good enough to perhaps come with a wize suggestion on the matter? I have as I said just started this, so I have not experimented that much yet, i started earlier today, but alas had to go to work before I got anywhere.

In other words, there will be an accelerando in the repetition of the unmodified sound. 2 points Layer 3 On this layer the sound will play over and over but the speed/pitch will change randomly so sometimes the sound will play faster (up to a tenth of a second) and sometimes the sound will play slower (up to 10 seconds).

so today i made a couple of abstractions that let me visually choose which sections of a loop i want to trigger.
the first is [breakpoint-maker], which you can use to line up your sample cut points and create a message box with all your cut-point data.
and then the second is a little player abstraction called [smp-slice] that allows for pitched playback and sequencing of the sample sections.
much nicer and cleaner sample cutting for sure.

I have generated all the patches for my system, so for most people, you won't even need to generate the patches. They are located in the ladspa dir (install this in a pd lib dir).
You can check out how it works with demo.pd. demo.mid is a seq24 midi score.
plugins.txt is the info that the script spits out, when you run it, you can use it as reference when making your own patches.
You will probably need to fine-tune the generated patches, because the ladspa meta-data for control inputs isn't always accurate and sometimes a toggle is better then a slide, for example (see demo.pd for a few examples of tuned patches).
My demo patch also illustrates using midi record on/off messages.

983,Fatosc~,Fatosc~,"hello all.
I'm a total newcomer here, and I have more or less 2 days working experience with Pd 
so please bear with me for the ""bad coding"" or naivety or whatever. anyway, this is my first Pd patch, and I thought it deserves to be shared.
it is a morphing oscillator with controllable fatness, thus called ""fatosc~"". it has 2 inlets (frequency and fatness) and one outlet (the noise!).
the ""fatosc~demo"" patch features an oscilloscope and can be eventually played via MIDI. (no envelope or fancy stuff, monophonic and note on/off sensing seems to be a bit flakey).
I originally coded the oscillator for a completely different project of mine, but wanted to do some quick soundcheck with a realtime system, and Pd fitted just perfectly.
the original C code looks like this:
if(phase > 0.75) {
    output = -1.0 + pow((phase-0.75)*4.0, fatness);
} else if(phase > 0.50) {
    output = -1.0 + pow(1.0-(phase-0.50)*4.0, fatness);
} else if(t > 0.25) {
    output = 1.0 - pow((phase-0.25)*4.0, fatness);
} else {
    output = 1.0 - pow(1.0-phase*4.0, fatness);
}

I had a hardtime figuring out a Pd equivalent for if/else. and I'm still not sure I got it right 
anyway: with fatness=1 the oscillator generates a triangle wave. with fatness=PI, it generates a sine wave (don't know if it's a mathematically pure sine, but it looks pretty similar). going up with the fatness, it approximates a square wave.
on the other hand, with fatness < 1 it generates a nice looking curved triangle waveform, which I've called ""jawtooth"". I was really thinking ""shark tooth"", but my fingers are faster than thought 
with very small fatness values, it ""degenerates"" to almost silence.
should be interesting to do some FM or other modulation with it. that's what I'm going to try next.
hope you find it useful and/or entertaining.
PS. of course, the algorithm is ""pat.pend."", so if you're going to use it in a commercial product, my horde of lawyers will knock at your door and haunt you in your dreams.
ok, just jocking, feel free to do whatever you like with it.
critics welcome!
cheers,
Aldo

this is my first post to the pd-forum. here are my patches and a few
ideas about dealing with rhythm.
i was thinking about a 16 step midi-sequenzer and how to get different
types of playing it.
first thought was to use a mainmetro, all sequenzparts can be sync-ed to -
plus adding a channelmetro so any part can switch to it and play in it's own bpm.
further the sequencer contains: sliders (below the triggers) to shift every
note up to one step to get more concret rhythm - a numberbox to adjust
the length of the part - and a toggle to play backward. similar to step-shifter,
swing (the big h_slider) is made to shift the whole part up to one step
(to the right).
on the right of the sequencers is the midi_selector...
coming up with a korg electribe mx i use that to trigger the synth-parts
and its working pretty precise.
i like to add some other stuff , like random...

I play the patch with my Yamaha EZ-AG connected to a Dell Windows XP laptop running through the YEZge program to filter out unwanted MIDI messages.
I wrote it all using plain old vanilla Pure Data so it should hopefully work everywhere.

What is it: Basically my own DJ type set up based around 4 channels of looping audio and controlled with a joystick.
It includes;
a really crappy reverb/delay which i decided will make for a nice finish.
ring modulator.(tunable is the word i guess?)
flanger.
and a ""sustain"" which basically lets you grab a small piece of audio and loop it while changing how often it plays back.(I found it here http://digital.music.cornell.edu/node/577 , while i can't find how to contact the guy, on his blog he says feel free to use it, so i've credited him in the patch)
The ring mod and flanger can be run independantly for each channel of audio, you just have to hold down the corresponding button for the channel, while turning the effect on.
I really would have liked to include a stutter like I've seen in Hardoff's patches, but I couldn't work it out, and figured I had enough to play around with for now.

Hello I've just downloaded PD and begun to work through the manual
I'm a newbie with a severe need of pointing in the right direction and questions answering like are these things possible?
I am working on a mac. I have a excel spreadsheet of data collected from a weather machine. I have put 'ifs' in new columns to create parameters to generate columns of note, note length, timeline position and velocity. This happens with 6 different parts.
I have then lovingly pasted each answer into logic express 7 to create lovely music. Logic express won't even allow me to paste a line at a time.
So as you can imagine terribly time consuming.
So can I write something with PD that either I paste the original excel data in one big chunk into or get it to read the data. Can I then write these parameters into PD as excel only lets me write so much before I have to send it to the next column. At the moment I have utter belief in another way forward so I'm not refining my excel virtuosity. And it takes me ages to prepare another sheet of data.
Anyhow can PD facilitate me pasting 3 different columns of data to generate six parts of music with 4 different parameters note, note length, timeline and velocity?
Where do I start ? I imagine that there are patches that do very similar things but this is only my biased imagination. After skimming through the manual to try to find something equal to what I want I get to I think that it is ""chapter 9 data structures"" that my level of understanding needs to reach to.
So should I just sit an work through the manual till here should I go to this workshop in Amsterdam. http://www.mediamatic.net/artefact-15576-en.html?lang=en
Should I pursue a different direction completely? Is Pd what I want?
I have a bit of a time limit for an exhibition in middle of October.
I could continue to paste results from excel which is quite dreary and gives neck ache.
Is there a ready made patch out there or something I could quite simply alter?

This is just a crazy experiment - well, dunnow if ""experiment"" is the word (but ""crazy"" certainly is). I just thought that this could be done in PD and so I did it, to check if I was wrong.
This is... well... the old and glorious Tetris game, recreated in PD.
And this is just standard official PD distribution with no weird externals - the ""miller pucket version"" downloaded from the official site.
Here it is:
http://puredata.org/Members/matteosistisette/tetrispatch
Just unzip the archive, and run ""tetris.pd"".
Let me know if it doesn't work - it should since I did it with the standard distribution... I suppose.
It also have music (the classical tetris theme), though at the moment it lacks sound effects (kind of a shame isn't it).
It is made of a lot of toggles moving around...
I attach the zip file.
I would love to read some comments.

1068,Which patch is faster?,Which patch is faster?,"These are two abbreviated versions of a patch I'm working on.
As far as I can tell, these two patches do the exact same thing. In both patches, after the right inlet is set, changing the left inlet will either a) send 1's to the object boxes when the inlets are different, or  send 0's to the object boxes and then trigger the bangs when the inlets are the same.

Some questions I have:
1. Am I overlooking anything? Are they really exactly the same (in terms of function)?
2. [sel] and [sel 0] apparently work the same if the right inlet is avoided. Is there a good reason to use one and not the other?
3. Which of the two (if any) is cheaper processor-wise, or which of the two is faster (and why)?
4. Is there an even better way to do this?
5. I'm working on Windows XP and I tried using [cputime] but either I don't really know how to use it, or it doesn't work the way I expect it to. I guess what confuses me is that the right inlet is hot, not cold... anyway, any clarification will be appreciated.

I've been toying around with pd recently and I decided to build a simple monosynth to start. I control it with an 8-knob midi keyboard where the knobs change things like osc pitch, adsr values, and filter cutoff and resonance.
I realize that the adsr patch is a little awkward--I'll clean that up soon. But I think I fried my brain on taxes and I can't figure out how to make a good resonant lowpass filter. I stacked 8 of the lop~ objects and I think it output an 8-pole filter without resonance.
Does anyone have any ideas how to make filters with resonance? I tried the vcf~ object, but it was screwy and band-pass.
Secondly, (again, taxes hurt my head), I can't think of any clean examples of lfo's that send control messages (the thin lines). I messed around with an env~ object and an osc~, but it was goofy and didn't work effectively. Any help or patches would be a help.

I have the following problem: I have a text file, which contains some heterogenous data. Let me show you some example:

rest contains data specific for that object (I have many dynamic objects which I compose
on the fly through dyn~ external).
Now what I am doing to parse such a file is highly stupid and I'd like to find some more elegant solution:
I am using three textfile objects (each for one line). What I'd like to have is one textfile object and figure, how to route the reading logic so that the output from the textfile is routed to the branch I need. Here is some pseudocode through tmp status variable:
int status = 0;

case 1:

status = 2;

I'm trying to write a patch object, so I can get some debug information.
I am using the ""qlist"" object, but I don't know how to pass the arguments trough.
Any help?

1108,Fx-instruments ?!,Fx-instruments ?!,"Hi everybody !
For a university-project which deals with the binding of space and sound i urgently ned effect filters for use with pd.
We are settings up complex scenes in vrml for final use in a 4-wall virtual environment in stuttgart.
In these world wwe have sound linked to objects. when objects are transformed also sound will be transformed. this job will be done by PD. now i need typicla effect filtesr, like any old sample editing-prog offers.
I have already looked through what comes with the installation of PD.. it would take too much time to put them together myself.
i am looking for:
Flanger
pitch-shift
wah-wah
echo-chamber
stretch
chorus
delay
reverb
vibrato
..any of these for the use with mp3/wav- files.
controllers of these filters/instruments will be controlled from within the vrml scene...
it works aleady, but i am lacking more interesting instruments!
Please let me know of anything you might have ..!1
Thanx alot
