Map Object,"Hi Everyone!
I'm new to PD and it seems to me that there is no map-object like in processing, cinder, max/msp and... everywhere for mapping some value from one range to another. Am I just too stupid to find it or is PD really missing such an object?
Anyways, searching would probably have taken longer than making one, so here it is. I thought maybe somebody might need it, i use this thing in almost every patch i made! Shouldn't something like this be in the extended-package?
Tell me if you like it, and if there would have been an easier way 
Cheers
Adrian
