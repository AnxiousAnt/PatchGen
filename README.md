# Generating Pd patches using an LLM
## Project Summary
Purr-Data (Pd), a visual programming language for multimedia applications, offers a powerful and intuitive environment for sound and music creation. However, the initial learning curve for Pd can be daunting, especially for those unfamiliar with visual programming paradigms. Also, the experienced Purr-data users would want to generate patches faster. This project titled "Generating Pd Patches Using an LLM", aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the power of machine learning to assist users in creating Pd patches.
